The treatment of cataract is possible through surgery only .
Complete lens capsule is taken out in the method of Intra Capsular Cataract Extraction , after the operation spectacles are used post-test .
During operation lens is implanted at front of the iris , the frontal part of the eye .
In the Extra Capsular Cataract Method , the part of the frontal capsule and the whole of the lens matter is extracted and the posterior part of the capsule is left intact .
Lens is fitted in the capsular bag .
In the S . . . . -LRB- Small Incision Cataract Surgery -RRB- method . 6 mm tunnel is formed while the rest of the method follows like that of the ECCE-IOL .
No stitches are applied in the S . . . . -LRB- Small Incision Cataract Surgery -RRB- method .
In black cataract the eye nerves dilapidates gradually . It happens due to extra water pressure in the eye or because of not enough blood reaching in the eye nerves .
The blindness caused by the black cataract can be prevented if it is identified soon and its regular treatment and tests continue .
When the extra pressure is more in the eyes .
If somebody suffers from black cataract in the family .
In most of the patients the part of the water channel from the eyes are open yet for some reasons the water gets lessened .
Internal pressure keeps on increasing and the eye nerves dilapidates , gradually the patient can not see things around , eyesight might also be lost if treatment is not done in time .
Main symptoms on appearance of which a patient should consult a doctor .
Seeing rainbow like colorful ovals in light .
We will check the eye nerves with special lens or equipment to find how much of damage has occurred .
Field test , in which the capacity to see things on the sides while looking straight is tested .
The part -LRB- angle -RRB- from where the water passes out can be seen through a special lens .
With the lack of vitamin-A the cornea becomes weak and a wound appears through which at last causes blindness .
The lack of vitamin-A is even more imminent in states of measles and malnutrition .

Cancer is a lifestyle generated disease .
Cancer erupts by our wrong practices , thoughts , behavior and diet .
Smoking excessive cigarette causes more of windpipe cancer .
We progress towards development and getting rid of diseases .
Due to changes in our lifestyle the number of cancer and heart patients are increasing .
This disease is number one in Japan . In developed countries , this disease in at number 2 and in developing countries this disease is at number 3 .
One out of every eight persons can at any time become victim of cancer .
This disease found in different types at different locations in our country due to difference in the lifestyle , customs and religion .
All the data in the country has been calculated . Ovarian cancer and breast cancer is found in 40 percent of the women in cities .
It is between 60 and 65 percent among the rural women .
Lungs and breathing pipe cancer is found more due to smoking and pollution and the possibility of cancer of the mouth and stomach is more with gutkha , pan parag , tobacco and tobacco powder .
What is cancer .
Cancer is name of a disease .
In cancer cells multiply by itself and ignores the rules of the body .
Cells also reach other parts of the body .
Cell takes the form of a cyst or wound , and destroys all the systems coming in contact with it .
Cancer is a group of more than 1000 diseases .
Although each of the disease is different from the other but basically all the types of cancers occurs as a result of anomaly in some cells .
Generally , easy tumors can be weeded out through surgery and there is no possibility of its coming up again .
Difficult tumors are cancer .
Difficult tumors can destroy nearby tissues and parts .
Cancer cells can spread into other areas through which new tumors can get born .
As cancer can spread , it is necessary that the doctor should immediately find whether the tumor is formed and that it is cancer .
The treatment of cancer can start as soon as it is found .
Several symptoms shows up due to cancer that gives the impressions of cancer .
Details of some important symptoms are given below .
If there is an oxalate stone in the kidney what preventions could be advantageous .
Any wound that do not heal in enough time .
Cyst or swelling on breast or any other part of the body .
Abnormal passing of blood or pus from any part or organ of body .
Continuous prolonged bouts of cough or occurrence of heaviness in speech .
Pain in swallowing food or during toilet , continuous indigestion or constipation .
Change in general habits of bowels .
Sudden change in the size , color or shape of moles or warts .
However , such symptoms erupts not just because of cancer , there can be other reasons as well for these .
Therefore one should not take it as cancer just on its appearance .
Show these to the doctor if these symptoms stay for two weeks .
There is no doubt that immediate identification of most of the cancer diseases -LRB- 60-70 percent -RRB- is possible .
The need is to increase the knowledge about it and for every one to take care of oneself .
After identifying cancer early , total treatment is now possible for 60-70 percent of cancer patients .
Not only this , the cost of early identification and immediate treatment is also much lower than late treatment .
Besides being aware of the symptoms of cancer , all the men and the women should get themselves tested regularly .
Some types of cancers can be identified by general tests before any symptoms appear .
Doctors can find out cancer diseases of mouth , breast , cervix , skin , large intestine , rectum , prostate gland , testicle etc . even before any signs appear .
Cancer of the cervix is a common cancer of occurring among women .
Among all the cancers occurring in India 40 percent is that of cervix .
Lymph nodes are connected to lymph arteries and form a white liquid that is called lymph .
The web of lymph arteries is spread throughout the body like blood arteries .
Lymph nodes try to keep cancer cells to itself by filtering them .
On advancement of the cancer it is not able to do this and cancer spreads from one part of the body to other part by lymph .
That is why surgeons usually weed out the lymph nodes nearby the cervix also .
Cervical cancer can spread through blood circulation .
For changes in skin , particularly any kind of growth in moles or warts , you should get tested regularly .
Any kind of changes should be shown to the doctor immediately .
A doctor should also test the skin during general medical check-up .
Regular medical check-up is important for early detection of cancer of the large intestine and the rectum .
A doctor can find out about the disease by inserting gloved finger in the rectum .
Annual test of everybody after the age of 50 years is necessary .
Blood can occur with the faeces due to cancer of the large intestine .
A comprehensive test is mandatory for confirmed diagnosis . The doctor should do a sigmoidoscopy -LRB- telescopic test of the rectum -RRB- of the rectum and the large intestine in a period of 3 to 5 years for persons crossing the age of 50 years .
The most credible method of finding out the prostate cancer in its initial stage is the test of gloved finger by the doctor .
An annual check-up of everybody above the age of 40 years must be done .
With annual test any irregular or abnormal areas can be found out and it can be known whether there is a tumor or not .
Testicular gland cancer could be found out by most of the men themselves .
Men can find out any changes in the testicular gland by testing themselves every month .
The best time to test it is during the time of bathing with hot water or after , when the testicle is flaccid , as in this situation any changes can be easily figured out .
While testing the testicular gland by oneself , if one finds a swelling , cyst or any other kind of defect , particularly an abnormal pain on touching the testicular gland , pain or heaviness , then the doctor should consulted .
Testicular gland test should also be a part of the regular annual medical test of the humans by the doctors .
Regular test of mouth is required for the signs of mouth cancer .
Change of tissues of mouth can be the initial stage of cancer .
Change of tissues of mouth can be easily seen and experienced .
A dentist should test the mouth of every patient in every form .
Changes occurring in gum , lips and cheek should be paid attention .
Scab cracks , swelling , bleeding or cyst or tumor in any part of the mouth should be paid special attention .
You must get tested by a doctor or a dentist .
If you are eating tobacco , betel , pan masala or zarda then the test is even more essential .
You can also view your mouth in the mirror and in case of any changes , you can take advice of the doctor .
All the women should know how to test their own breasts and each month they should test their breasts themselves .
It is good to test the breasts a few days after the menstruation period when there is no possibility of breasts becoming large or any pains at all .
Even if the menstruation period has stopped , women should appoint a day -LRB- whenever -RRB- each month for test .
This test is specially important for women above the age of 40 years .
The danger of breast cancer increases in age above 40 years .
If a woman feels a cyst or any kind of change in the breasts she should consult a doctor .
About 80 percent of the cysts of the breasts are not cancer but only a doctor can correctly find it out .
Any abnormal situations like cyst in the breasts or breasts becoming very large must be tested during the medical test of women .
After the age of 40 years every women must get mammogram done in 1 to 2 years .
If the age of women goes up to 50 years then mammogram should be done every year .
The women whose mothers , sister , blood aunts etc . have cancer should start getting mammography done since 25-30 years .
Cancer is tested through pathology .
It is seen in microscope .
Cancer can be found out through other tests like X-ray . . . Scan . . . . ultrasound also .
List of training test centres where cancer can be tested .
Surgery depends on the stage of the cancer .
If cancer is in a limited area and in initial stage then along with the affected area some normal areas are also extracted .
It is attempted that no particle of cancer is left out .
If cancer has also entered other areas then surgery is done to lessen the size of the cancer .
Cancer cells are burnt through laser .
Before laser , calculation of area of cancer , spread , capacity of the patient , time of laser based on the cancer , stage , area strength is done .
Then a mark applied on the skin .
Entry for any other person is prohibited in that room during the laser .
There is no pain in radioactive rays .
Sometimes the skin may become red or patient may feel like vomiting .
Some cancers like blood cancer and the cancer of the cysts can be fully treated with medicine .
These medicines destroy the cancer cells .
General cells may also be affected with these medicines .
Nails may fall .
There might occur a decrement in blood which may cause tiredness .
If the patient takes medicine in regular cycle and eats healthy food he can recover fully .
During the treatment blood should be tested regularly , one should have clean water and clean food .
One should not sit with a sick person because the immune strength gets very lessened with medicines .
Incurable cancer patients are kept in palliative care so that their physical , mental pain could be lessened .
List of hospitals where the treatment of cancer is available .
Awareness and prevention from cancer .
Prevention from tobacco and tobacco related products and quitting control .

Information related to cancer , its symptoms , harms of tobacco , self-breast test and prevention has been given in Junior High Schools .
All the hospitals , Superintendant Base hospital , district hospital , women hospital , medical college and private hospitals in the state have been asked to maintain a cancer register .
They will register cancer patients coming to their outdoor department and post this report to the directorate every month .
We will find out what is the number of cancer patients in the state and in which area which cancer has been found more .
Chicken pox -LRB- varicella -RRB- .
Chicken pox is a viral that erupts out of a contact with varicella zoster -LRB- VZV -RRB- .
Fever and eruption of a special kind of papules is the sign of chicken pox .
A virus spreads from one person to another person through air born drops .
It erupts through the spread of the spray of saliva in the nearby environment on sneezing or coughing of a person infected with chicken pox .
It can also spread through a direct contact with chicken pox or herpes because there is contagious liquid in raw wounds .
In some cases it can also spread from an infected pregnant mother to the unborn or to a new born baby .
Chicken pox is the most contagious a few days before the papules erupt and before the scab spreads over the wounds i . . till it dries up which often happens a week after the spots have started .
Fever , shivering , nausea and vomiting are the most clear and famous symptoms , eruption of blisters and extreme itching freckles .
In most of the children 200-300 blisters erupt that later become scabs .
Chicken pox can attack both young and adult , men and women .
Most of the people become victim of chicken pox one time or the other in their childhood or adolescence .
But if adults who had never been a victim of chicken pox come into contact with such a case , they are in danger of contraction and they may suffer from chicken pox in adulthood .
Chicken pox is more serious in adolescents and adults in comparison with children .
Fever stays for a longer time .
Keeping infected persons away from school or work helps in decreasing the spread of the virus but vaccination is an effective solution to escape the pain of chicken pox .
Fever is estimated with symptoms like high fever , acute body pain , headache , joint pain , eye pain and finding of papules on body .
Besides the above general symptoms , complaints of bleeding from teeth , mouth or nose also occur in serious patients of chicken pox .
Tourniquet test comes positive in chicken pox patients and platelet count is found less than 1 lac on blood test .
Dengue fever occurs after a sting of aedes aegypti .
Aedes aegypti is also known by the name of tiger mosquito and it stings during the day time .

Diabetes is such a kind of disease as a result of which sugar becomes very high in blood .
Diabetes is a serious disease which , if not controlled , can be killing .
On being under attack of diabetes our body forms insulin which helps in lessening sugar .
Sugar increases in the blood with lack of insulin .
If you have the following symptoms then you may have diabetes .
Frequent feeling of urination .
Feeling more thirsty and dim vision .
Physical inability in sexual activities .
Numbness in feet or paralysing feeling in them .
Problems occurring from diabetes .
The following problems and complexities can emerge from diabetes .
Excess of sugar in blood , long term complexities .
Damage to tendons or neuropathy .
Damage to kidney or nephropathy .
Damage to eyes or retinopathy .
Disease and contraction of heart and blood vessels .
Long term complexities of diabetes .
damage to tendons : diabetes damages the tendons of feet and hands .
Shivering , numbness , inflammation or pain may occur due to damage to the tendons which often starts from the tip of the fingers of your feet or hands and increases gradually upwards .
If treatment is not done then you can lose the power of feeling in the affected organs .
Damage to kidney : Delicate filtering system present in the kidney may be damaged with diabetes by which kidneys may stop working and dialysis or kidney transplantation may be required .
Diabetes may damage the retina of your eyes which may cause blindness .
Disease of heart and blood vessels : The main complexity of diabetes is the damage of heart and blood vessels by which heart attack , paralysis and defect in blood circulation may occur .
Studies have proved that dangers of heart attack and paralysis is more among the people with diabetes than those who do not have diabetes .
Excess of sugar in the infected blood decreases your immune strength and the danger of infection increases by this .
Your mouth , gums , lungs , skin , feet , kidney , bladder and the areas of reproductive organs , all of them can be easily affected with contagion .
Dangers of diabetes related complexities can be decreased to a great extent with the control of sugar in the blood and adopting healthy lifestyle .
The chances of bringing the situation back to the pre-damage stage or minimizing it increases by finding out the complexities early through regular medical tests .
Every disease occurs due to a type of virus .
Virus is so small that they can not be seen through common microscope .
If polluted mosquito bites a person then the virus enters into the body of that person .
After about 4 to 14 days the symptoms of disease start appearing in that person .
Usually the following symptoms are found in the patients of diabetes .
High fever .
Acute pain .
Stiffness in neck .
Stiffness in body .
Strokes in body .
Nausea and vomiting .
Fainting or total nervousness .
As soon as the above mentioned symptoms appear the patient should immediately be admitted for treatment at the nearby primary health center , sub-divisional government hospital or district hospital .
Malaria spreads through mosquitoes therefore it is necessary that the number of mosquitoes be decreased in community .
Disease carrying mosquitoes mainly reside outside home in paddy fields , ponds and ditches filled with water .
Pay special attention towards cleanliness at home and outside .
Fill the ditches , cut tall grass and bushes .
Wear pants , pyjama , dhoti , socks , full sleeved kurta or shirt in the evening .
Use mosquito nets while sleeping wherever possible .
Do not let rain water collect near the ditches nearby house .
Cooperate with the health staffs in sprinkling insecticides and fogging .
Use fine nets to stop mosquitoes enter the pigsties .
Get the vaccine of encephalitis administered in time .
Hepatitis-A is one of the most widespread disease spreading in the whole world .
This occurs due to Hepatitis-A virus and it is common at places with bad level of cleanliness .
Virus attacks lever and causes diseases of different intensity to emerge in the patients .
Hepatitis-A viral spreads in the faeces and at first it spreads through the anal passage .
The virus comparatively takes long time to show symptoms and is contagious .
Therefore the infected person can spread the disease to other people even before it develops .
Nausea , jaundice , purge , light colored faeces , stomach ache , weakness , tiredness , fever , shivering , not feeling hungry , neck pain etc .
Symptoms are dependent on the frequency of emergence .
Hepatitis-A and V are two different kinds of viral hepatitis that occur due to different kinds of viruses .
Every type of hepatitis is different .
Hepatitis-A can not be avoided with the vaccination of hepatitis-B .
Similarly , hepatitis-B can not be avoided with the vaccination of hepatitis-A .
The vaccine is available now and is the most practical solution against hepatitis-A .
Primary vaccination keeps a person safe for a year and the booster dose administered after six months gives safety for about 20 years .
A combined vaccine is available from Glaxosmithkline which provides safety from , both hepatitis-A and hepatitis-B through a single safety order administered at 0 . . months .
The combined vaccine of hepatitis-A and hepatitis-B is available in two forms .
Paediatric dose : One dose is of 0 . ml for children and adolescents .
Adult dose : The dose is of 1 . ml for adults of the age of 16 years and above .
Hepatitis-B is a worldwide disease which occurs due to hepatitis-B virus -LRB- HBV -RRB- .
HBV affects mainly liver by which an inflammation occurs .
The cells of liver gets destroyed and the function of liver often gets interrupted .
The results of infection are different and unexpected .
The results of infection are dependent on the age of patient and state of the capacity of the immune system .
Hepatitis-B is extremely contagious and it is thought to be 100 times more contagious than the HIV .
In comparison with AIDS , Hepatitis-B victimises more people to death in the whole year .
Blood is the most important vehicle in the spread of hepatitis-B disease but it can also spread through other body fluids in which sperm , vaginal fluids and saliva are included .
HBV spreads in three ways , from mother to child , at birth time and from person to person .
The most effective and convenient solution for safety from hepatitis-B and its resultant chronic carrier state or liver cancer is vaccination .
After vaccination people who have developed protective anti-bacterial reactions can get total safety from intense and old contraction along with diseases .
With extensive use of hepatitis-B vaccination a remarkable decrease has been seen in hepatitis-B infection and the liver cancer arising out of long term hepatitis-B .
Yellow fever is also called yellow jack , black vomit , Negro 's vomit or American Plague .
The combined vaccine is made for children and adults .
What precautions should be taken after operation so that hernia does not occur again .
The huge problem of increasing population has stayed in India after independence .
The family welfare program was run at the national level in the year of 1952 .
On the subject of population and development it was suggested at an international conference in Cairo -LRB- Egypt -RRB- in the year of 1994 that it would be necessary for human welfare and development to conjugate reproductive health safety along with reforms to family welfare .
All the reproduction health safety should be kept in the form of a single element within family planning services .
Therefore the concept of Reproductive and Child Health Programme was born .
Reproductive and Child Health Programme is being run since the year of 1997 in India .
This program has been running in Uttarakhand since the constitution of the state .
Reproduction rate has always been low in Uttarakhand in comparison with the original state Uttar Pradesh .
Raw birth rate of this state in the period of 1951-1956 was 48 which decreased to become 35 in the period of 1976-1981 and during the years of 1994-2001 this rate lowered more and stayed at 26 only .
Among the districts this rate is the least in Paudi while the most in Haridwar .
Gross reproduction rate -LRB- the number of infants given birth by a woman in her life time -RRB- which was estimated to be more than 5 for the period of 1971-76 , has been continuously decreasing and in the year of 2001 this number was 3 . .
Inter district differences has also occurred less during this period .
Raw birth rate and gross reproduction rate has been different in urban and rural areas .
It is the desire of son that will affect the future reproductive level of the state .
Generally , birth rate is lower the hilly areas than in the plain areas .
About one fourth of the women give birth to the next child within 24 months .
A little less than half of the mothers -LRB- 46 percent -RRB- give birth to more than 3 kids .
About 42 percent of the births come in the category of serious danger .
It is difficult to comment on the tendencies and styles of the decrement in the death rate due to lack of information on death rate related to Uttarakhand in particular .
According to the estimates of Sample Registration System -LRB- S . . . -RRB- the death rate was estimated 7 on the population of every 1000 during the year of 2000 which is lower than the national average of 9 .
The infant mortality rate of the state was 50 every 1000 live births in the year of 2000 which is very less than the national rate -LRB- 68 -RRB- .
Two third deaths out of the total infant mortality number occurs during the period of infancy itself .
Infant mortality rate in Uttarakhand is 19 per 1000 live births .
Data related to maternal mortality rate of the state is not available .
Considering odd physical situations of the state it can be said that the maternal mortality rate in the state would be very high .
Non-communicable disease is becoming a big cause of death with changes occurring in the life style due to modernization and urbanization .
The goal of Reproductive and Child Health Welfare Programme is to bring about decline in the maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate .
This program is being run to give special importance to the participation of men with relation to Reproductive and Child Health Welfare Programme , to provide complete knowledge of protected and effective contraceptive methods to men and women , to make medical facilities available to the pregnant women during pregnancy and to help parents get healthy new born babies .
The goal of health programs is to increase the rate of parent security to 49 . percent till 2006 , 55 . percent till 2010 , and 95 percent till 2020 .
The rate of childbirth security to 60 percent till 2006 , 80 percent till 2010 and institutional childbirths has increased to the maximum .
Main works under the Reproductive and Child Health Programme .
Main works being run under the program are as follows .
Organisation of R . . . camps .
Organisation of R . . . Outdoor sessions .
Appointment of women health workers on contract .
Comprehensive construction work and repairing of health units .
Urban Reproductive and Child Health Programme .
Appointment of supplementary A . . . on contract .
Appointment of 258 supplementary A . . . on contract basis in the unserved and rural areas has been made to increase the immunisation of mothers and children and the acceptability of contraceptives .
On the directions of the Government of India service is being made available at 39 PHCs and 26 CHCs with the goal to provide secure childbirth from 8 o'clock at night to 7 o'clock in the morning at PHCs and CHCs .
900 untrained midwives have been trained in Uttarakhand in the year of 2001-2002 and 2002-03 to provide services of safe labor to pregnant mothers .
560 untrained midwives have been trained in the year of 2004-2005 .
5 Safe Maternity Counsellors -LRB- Women Medical Officer -RRB- were accepted to be appointed by the Government of India on a contract basis under the E . . . scheme .
After the advertisements in newspapers for appointment three women medical officers were selected out of which only 1 women medical officer has reported her contribution at Agastyamuni CHC of district Rudraprayag .
Care of the health of women and children and vaccination is being done on a village council level by organising an Outreach Session on a defined day -LRB- Saturday -RRB- by women health workers at the level of each village council in the state .
The said program has been scrapped by the Govt . of India since July , 2004 .
But the above mentioned program is being run in the state with the help of women health workers .
Medicines are being bought at the state level under the RCH program .
RCH kits are being provided directly to the districts by the Government of India .
For equipments bought at the level of the state the provision is to purchase after the recommendation of the Executive Committee constituted at the state level by the Purchase Committee constituted at the level of the Head Office .
Special work has been done in districts in the year of 2003-2004 for propagation of NSV -LRB- without cut , without stitch -RRB- method to increase the participation men in population stabilisation .
Population stabilisation , installation of stable RN hoarding , wall paintings , orientation of the members of the Panchayati Raj and medical and paramedical staff from the medical department and other media exhibition etc . were done .
Leprosy is a bacteria born contagious disease .
The name of this bacteria is microbacterium leprae .
Microbacterium leprae affects mainly the nervous system and the skin .
Incubation period of leprosy is three years on an average and this disease grows very slowly .
Leprosy can affect persons of any age and sex equally .
The M . . . medicine cures the patient completely by eradicating the leprosy bacteria and prevents the disease from spreading in the society .
All the leprosy patients are not contagious .
Most of the patients are non-contagious who can not spread the disease , only 15 to 20 percent patients are contagious .
Leprosy is comparatively much less contagious than other diseases such as measles . . . etc .
About 95 percent of the people have the resistance capability to fight leprosy thereby this disease can not happen to them .
The main symptoms and identification of leprosy are as follows .
A light yellow or discolored reddish spot or stain on skin of the body that has numbness . . . the spot has no feeling of pain , inflammation , itching or piercing or cold and hot .
Oily shine on the skin .
Thickness of cyst on skin , eyebrows , chin , ears .
Do not do any hard work for three months after the operation of hernia .
Thrilling sensation , numbness or dryness in hands or feet .
Occurrence of deformation in the fingers of hands or feet .
Initiation and spread of leprosy .
Leprosy often starts with a spot or freckle on the body that is numb .
If this gets treated in the initial stage then the disease is cured completely and the disability does not get aroused in it that is the main reason of social excommunication .
If the treatment is not done due to careless or lack of right information about leprosy then the disease keeps on growing .
Fingers start becoming malformed , wounds erupt in hands and feet and the face starts looking ugly .
Most of the people reach the doctor for advice in this stage .
Wounds and ulcer form because of no care for the numb and insensitive parts of the leprosy patients .
Complete treatment is possible even in the stage of wound and ulcer but the disability and deformity that occurred due to lateness in treatment can not be brought back to the previous state through medicines .
Yes , the hands and feet of the disabled person can be formed in such a way through simple operations so that the patient can work again and run his livelihood .
Malaria spreads through the bite of female anopheles mosquito .
Female anopheles mosquitoes get born in clean water and bites at night .
Fever along with shivering and cold comes often the third day .
You must change water collected in pots at home once a week .
Use mosquito nets while sleeping or apply mustard oil on open parts of the body .
Install fine nets on windows of house .
Do not let water collect near yourself .
If this is not possible then pour some petro-lubricants oil on the collected water .
The disease of measles can take a very serious form in developing countries because the death rate due to this is more than 10 percent .
Therefore it is recommended to administer its vaccination to the children at the earliest possible .
Besides the antibody level of mothers and doses of vaccination , considering the incidents of the disease it is recommended by the World Health Organisation to administer the vaccine of measles to the children at the age of nine months .
Among the indications and symptoms of measles are included - fever , common symptoms of cold , conjunctivitis , cough , stains inside mouths and the red papules erupting on the skin .
Besides this , loose motion , stomach ache and lack of hunger like symptoms may also be show up during the contraction .
In comparison with children the symptoms of measles shows up more seriously in adolescents , its incubation period is about 10-12 days and almost no symptoms of this disease shows up from outside during this period .
During the period of 10 to 12 days , at first a local contraction occurs due to the virus in the breathing passage and then the contagion spreads into other parts of the body as well .
After this having spread through the whole of the blood circulation the virus takes the form of primary disease .
The period between the entrance of the bacteria and the start of the disease .
Mumps or contagious perotitis is a kind of serious contagious disease in which a swelling emerges in one or both of saliva glands near the jaws and starts paining .
Saliva glands are present inside the cheeks in front of the ears and respectively on the lower surface of the mouth .
Besides this , mouth also starts drying up due to mumps .
Rubella or German measles is also extremely contagious which occurs in children , adolescents and youths .
Rubella occurring immediately after birth is generally nominal and stays only for a while .
The most clear symptoms of rubella disease light red papules . The most important problem of this disease is that its virus grows very fast as a result of which birth defects occur in children .
About 25 to 50 percent of rubella contraction does not get known and when its symptoms emerge they are very light and shows up clearly .
When rubella occurs in adults then fever comes to them two days before the papules emerge and their hunger also gets lessened .
Live attenuated vaccines of measles , mumps and rubella are in the form an amalgamated single vaccine which is called MMR .
MMR vaccines are more effective because there are different related breed in this single virus vaccine .
The use of MMR vaccines has been extremely effective .
Immunisation power achieved with MMR stays for more time and almost throughout the life .
Start exercises three months after operation to keep muscles of stomach healthy .
However the goal of the first step taken for measles is execution of Primary Vaccination Programme .
The World Health Organisation believes that a single dose is not enough to eradicate measles .
Therefore now it is recommended by both W . . . and the UNICEF that besides giving its first dose at 9 months administration of second vaccine is also very necessary to protect these children from measles .
Disorder of the brain , that affects the capacity to think , understand , work or feel .
Such a system of brain is called mental disorder .
It is estimated that 1-2 percent of the population are afflicted with serious mental disease and about 5 percent are victims of common mental disease .
It is estimated that out of the outdoor patients coming to the hospitals 25 percent are mentally ill .
Mental disease can occur in several ways for as purblindness , epilepsy , sleeplessness , hypersomnia , change in copulation and copulation process , mood change , schizophrenia , dementia , delirium , change in personality .
Yellow fever is an extreme virus generated disease .
Yellow fever is a main disease is African and Latin American countries .
It is called yellow fever because in many of its patients symptoms of jaundice shows up .
Not paying attention to any work .
Being sad without any reason .
Getting angry very soon , very often .
Change in mood very soon , being sorry from happiness and getting happy again .
Getting disturbed soon by the small talk of children .
Thinking oneself as always correct and others wrong .
Emergence of desire to take tobacco , alcohol , cannabis , marijuana .
Problem in desire or the process of copulation .
Before declaring mental disorder for any patient his total mental agony is seen -LRB- in which present problems , old and new problems , family or problems near him can be seen -RRB- and then his physical and mental test is done .
If needed , lab tests of ECG , RFT , LFT , EEG and CT scan , diagnostic standardized intervenes and psychological test are done .
Treatment of mental diseases can be done through the following methods .
Listening to the patient and his family and providing information about his mental health .
Encouraging the patient to change emotionally .
Making people aware by propagating for mental health through press . . . radio , health fairs , posters , banners etc in every district .
Making social environment better , encouraging participation and social relations among people in the society .
Finding out about the mental , social and personality change since the start .
Running tests in schools , colleges , government and non-government institutes .
Treating emotional and mental disorders , enabling families to undergo difficult situations .
Solving the social and personal problems of the patient .
Treating the mental patient and lessening the difficulty of the family and society .
Saving a mental patient from falling ill again .
The following is be executed in the state under the mental health program .
State Mental Health Authority has been constituted in the state since 4 April , 2002 .
A 30 bed State Mental Hospital is being constructed at Dehradun under the Mental Health Authority program .
Two districts of Uttarakhand have been chosen under the District Mental Health Programme .
Dehradun in the Garhwal division and Nainital in the Kumaun division .
For which a proposal of 184 . 30 lac has been sent to the Government of India .
This program will be implemented in both the districts of Dehradun and Nainital .
The National Maternity Benefit Scheme has been transferred from Social Welfare Department to Health Welfare Department since 14 . . 2001 by the Government of India .
The process of transfer is now complete .
The National Maternity Benefit Scheme is being implemented by the Health Department in the state of Uttarakhand .
Under the National Maternity Benefit Scheme above 19 year old women living below the poverty line are given an assistance of Rs . 500 on first live delivery for proper nutrition .
The details of the capital received from the Government of India and the intended beneficiaries in 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 under the National Maternity Benefit Scheme are as follows .
The following programs are being run in the state of Uttarakhand under the Maternity and Infant Welfare Services .
A little less than half of the pregnant women are able to get pre-delivery tests done in Uttarakhand while this is 65 percent at the national level .
The percentage of the women getting the pre-delivery test done thrice is only 18 .
There is a huge difference in view of the numbers of women getting the advantage of pre-delivery services in the urban and the rural areas .
More than three fourth of the women -LRB- 78 percent -RRB- in the urban areas gets the pre-delivery test done at least once while a little more than one third of rural pregnant women do so .
A little more than one third -LRB- 39 percent -RRB- of the pregnant women take supplementary doses of iron folic acid pills .
In cases of tetanus toxide injection 54 percent of the pregnant women have got two or more than two injections of T . . however such women in the rural areas are 49 percent and in the urban areas 77 percent .
Generally there is much less vogue of pre-delivery services among uneducated mothers and in the families of low living standards , the following works are done mainly under this service .
Indicating pregnant women .
Distribution of pills to prevent anemia and referencing of proper cases of complex cases .
There are only 21 percent of institutional delivery in Uttarakhand .
This is 42 percent in cities while in rural areas more than 82 percent of labor occurs at home and out of these more than half of these conclude with the help of the midwives .
Even in urban areas more than half -LRB- 56 percent -RRB- of childbirths takes place at home .
In Uttarakhand about one fourth of the childbirths conclude with the help of doctors and about 10 percent with trained maids , assistant health workers and midwives .
Out of seven childbirths completing outside the medical institutions only one childbirth -LRB- 14 percent -RRB- is benefitted with post-labour tests within two months .
Safe childbirth and referencing of complex cases is mainly done under the post-childbirth services .
Care for mother and the newborn baby , referencing of complex cases , vaccination of babies , distribution of vitamin-A solution to protect children from blindness , proper advice and services for limited family and family planning and abortion .
A comparative detail of the achievements under maternity services till the year of 2001-2002 , 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 has been shown in the following table .
The disease called poliomyelitis occurs due to an extremely contagious virus which attacks only humans .
This contagious virus spreads generally through the medium of water or on coming in contact with infected person .
However this disease can also spread through mouth to mouth .
Polio disease particularly attacks young children .
80 to 90 percent of the cases of polio are often seen in children less than 3 years of age .
Polio is an extremely contagious disease .
Till the infection of one person in the family is known the possibility of contraction to other members also arises because this infection spreads rapidly , this virus spreads faster because of crowded places clean toilet facilities .
Oral Poliovirus Vaccine -LRB- OPV -RRB- was first used in the contemporary Soviet Union .
As a result of the technique developed in this country new methods of controlling or eradicating polio was discovered in other countries .
The most relevant proof of the great success of OPV is the Polio Eradication Programme being run throughout the world .
The Pulse Polio Programme run in India for polio eradication has also been very much successful .
Combined DTP vaccines have been used the world over since 1940 itself and great success has been achieved in lessening the clinical pertussis with its help .
By giving 3 doses of DTP vaccines to children they can be made protected against the disease like diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis .
Diphtheria is such a contagion that affects throat , mouth and nose .
Diphtheria is a contagious disease , easily contractible , but after its vaccine being developed it is found less very less .
Sex related diseases are contagious diseases . This disease gets communicated from the infected patient to one 's sex partner during sexual intercourse .
This is the reason that these diseases are called sexually transmitted diseases , their contraction is easy .
Contraction of sexually transmitted diseases is easy .
Sexually transmitted diseases are serious and painful .
The most found diseases of the sexually transmitted disease group are - gonorrhoea , herpes chlamydia .
Many sexually transmitted diseases show some symptoms initially , these symptoms end without any treatment .
Some sexual diseases specially in women create either common symptoms or no symptoms at all .
Person infected with sexual disease looks totally healthy but he can infect his sexual partner or unborn children .
Uncommon oozing or stench , pain below abdomen -LRB- between naval and the reproductive organs -RRB- .
Inflammation near vagina or pain in the depths of the vagina , symptoms both is men and women .
Wounds near reproductive organs , swelling or papules and crust in mouth , pain with inflammation in the urinary tract while urinating or excreting .
Fever , cold , body ache like in flu , swelling near reproductive organs .
If proper treatment of sexually infected diseases is not done then complexities may arise in them .
Dead birth due to inborn syphilis .
The birth of undeveloped baby may also occur due to contagious diseases .
Blindness in children due to gonorrhoea contraction .
Swelling in conjuctiva of the eye .
Contracted sexual behavior is the best method for safety from sexually generated disease .
The following directions could be helpful in sexually transmitted disease .
Do not copulate with the sexual partners who have papules , reddening , wound or inflammation in their reproductive organs .
Keep away from uncommon sexual relations .
Wash the reproductive organs immediately after sexual intercourse .
HIV contraction can also be lessened with safety from sexually generated diseases .
It is always right to do immediate treatment to stop spread of contraction in case of the occurrence of complexities .
Remember , encourage for regular tests if safe sexual behavior is not followed .
Most of the sexually generated disease get completely treated with proper treatment .
Tuberculosis is a contagious disease .
Tuberculosis occurs due to contraction of microbacterium tuberculosis .
The tuberculosis disease spreads through air from a tuberculosis patient to a healthy person and can happen to people of any age or sex .
A tuberculosis patient can infect 10-15 persons in a year .
About 1000 adults die everyday of tuberculosis in India which is much higher than the total number of deaths occurring due to all other diseases .
Tuberculosis can occur in any part of the body such as lungs , bones , joints or the sides of lymph nodes .
This disease is found commonly in the lungs .
In comparison to any other infected patients the youths die the most of the disease .
Because it is the youths who die the most of it therefore social and economic loss is much .
The quantity of tuberculosis in the society is too much . People are afraid to say about this and proper tests could not be get done .
In comparison to any other disease there are more orphans due to tuberculosis .
According to fresh research 3 lac children in India drop out of school due to this disease every year .
The maximum number of tuberculosis patients in the world are found in India .
Although the incidence of privilege rate is not available but studies state that the incidence rate is about 256 per lac .
In comparison to any other disease women die the most of tuberculosis in India .
The number of women dying of tuberculosis is more than the deaths caused by all other reasons combined .
This has been found in fresh studies that one lac women are thrown away from homes because of tuberculosis .
In comparison with healthy humans the danger of tuberculosis in HIV positive humans increases 5 times .
Tuberculosis infected patients should be treated with the DOTS strategy .
Coughs of 3 weeks or more is the chief symptom of tuberculosis -LRB- of the lungs -RRB- .
The easy way of diagnosis of tuberculosis of the lungs is three times test of the phlegm .
The bacteria of the tuberculosis comes out of the patient in the form of droplets on coughing or sneezing .
The bacteria out in the air enters into healthy humans through breath and infects the healthy person with tuberculosis .
Diagnosis is done by testing the bacteria of tuberculosis in the phlegm , X-ray is also used if necessary .
List of training test centres where cancer can be tested .
Tuberculosis can be completely cured .
If the patient does the treatment regularly .
There is treatment for tuberculosis but on recovering a little the patient quits treatment .
Treatment in tuberculosis is now done through the DOTS strategy .
In DOTS strategy patient is administered medicines under the direct care of the health workers .
Which is called DOTS -LRB- Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy -RRB- .
As is revealed from the name - Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy means that patient takes short courses of anti-tuberculosis drugs in presence of health worker .
There are two stages in the treatment of tuberculosis .
Intensive phase which goes on for 2-3 months .
Continuation phase is of 4-5 months which depends on the category of the treatment patient is taking .
Under this program these medicines are taken thrice a week on alternate days for 2-3 months -LRB- intensive phase -RRB- .
After this phlegm is tested which if found negative , the patient is issued anti-tuberculosis drugs once in a week in the calendared multi-blistered combo pack .
Remember , the first dose of the weekly pack has to be taken before the health worker .
During the continuation phase after two months phlegm should be tested and also after the treatment is complete .
You will watch the patient during the period of continuation phase .
The best way to check the disease is that if all the phlegm patients are made negative then the patient can not infect and whoever human is having coughs of more than three weeks then he should be encouraged to take DOTS after the three phlegm test .
Yellow fever is mosquito communicated disease .
Yellow fever is supposed to be the cause of several epidemics .
Yellow fever occurs due to an arbovirus of the family of flaviviridae .
Arbovirus is a gram positive single-formula RNA virus .
Like malaria this virus also enters into humans through mosquito saliva .
The mosquitoes that spread yellow fever aedes simpsaloni , aedes africanus and aedes aegypti .
Children can be saved from tuberculosis by administering BCG vaccine .
Vaccine must be administered after birth as early as possible .
Refer the patient for treatment to the near primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center .
Send the persons having cough with phlegm or without phlegm or phlegm with blood for three weeks or more to the primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center for tests .
Keep enquiring about the tuberculosis patients whether they went to the primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center for advice or not .
You must get all the babies of the area vaccinated for BCG with the help of the health workers -LRB- women -RRB- .
Educate people all about the prevention of tuberculosis and controlling it .
Two medicine stores - Dehradun and Udham Singh Nagar - have been built in the state to distribute medicines .
So that the medicines could be made available to far-off districts in time .
Supply of medicines is done by the Government of India .
To run Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme properly a four-wheeler vehicle has been made available by the Government of India in 8 districts -LRB- Tehri , Paudi , Uttarkashi , Chamoli , Nainital , Pithauragarh , Almora and Dehradun -RRB- .
Each treatment centres has been provided with a two-wheeler by the Government of India .
Each Microscopic Centre has been provided with one binocular microscope .
5 districts -LRB- Haridwar , Udham Singh Nagar , Rudraprayag , Bageshwar and Champawat -RRB- have been provided with four wheeler vehicle by the State Government .
Tetanus is a type of infection which occurs due to such bacteria that are found in dust , dirt and rusted metals .
The bacteria of tetanus enters inside through normal cuts occurring to the body .
Muscles convulse because of the bacteria .
If the bacteria attack the muscles of the jaws then jaws convulse and the mouth neither opens nor it closes .
Generally it is very fast but some of its slow cases shows up when a person is already infected with a flavivirus .
After the infection the virus at first increases its number by reproducing locally , after that it spreads throughout the body through lymph carrying arteries .
The muscle of the breathing pipe also convulse due to tetanus .
This is a kind of bacteria that closes the lungs with phlegm -LRB- a kind of sticky , wet material -RRB- due to which such an acute sound comes out on coughing as if a dog is barking .
The start of yellow fever starts suddenly 3 to 5 days after the infection .
Because of bacteria such organisms may also emerge that causes pneumonia and bronchitis -LRB- infection of the lungs -RRB- .
Typhoid fever is such a disease that starts as an infection in the gastrointestinal passage and takes the form of a full-fledged disease .
The cause of typhoid is a type of insect that is called salmonella typhi .
Each patient has different symptoms of it but some symptoms are included in common symptoms - periodic fever , headache , tiredness and weakness , change in behavior and stomach problems in the initial stage of the disease and constipation followed by loose motion .
When any food item or beverage with salmonella typhi is taken then generally most of organic constituents become inactive by the presence of the acid present in the abdomen .
If these insects reach the abdomen in great numbers then some of these insects reach the small intestine .
Vaccine is the most effective and reliable solution for safety for typhoid fever .
Typhoid vaccination is recommended by different international and national health officers for persons traveling the regional areas .
This vaccination is also recommended for school children and youth and adults as well in the areas where typhoid fever is present as a major public health problem in the persons of that age group .
Salmonella typhi with antibiotic resistance is found in typhoid fever .
This is how you should take care of your teeth .
High fever , cold , bleeding from skin , high heart pulse , headache , waist pain and diabetes occur in serious cases of yellow fever .
The death rate goes up to 85 % on the spread of yellow fever as an epidemic .
Yellow fever disease spreads in different ways in the rural and jungle areas and in the urban areas .
The effect is very high in the cities due to more density of population and more carrier mosquito population .
There is no real treatment for yellow fever .
Most of the virus generated diseases do not have a cure , only corollary treatment and treatment on the basis of symptoms are done .
The patient of fever should be given a lot of rest , fresh air and plenty of liquid to drink .
In the hamster model of the yellow fever using ribavirin early is considered to an effective treatment .
Ribavirin is effective in yellow fever in the same as it proves effective in hepatitis-C .
Historical report says that the death rate in this disease has been from 5 . % to 33 % .
CDC has said that the death rate is considered to be 15 .
While the WHO has said in a fact sheet issued in 2001 that 15 % patients enter a toxic stage in which half of them die and half are saved .
Yellow fever has an very important place in the history of Afric , America , Europe and the Caribbean Islands .
Yellow fever spread the worst in 1978 in the United States due which 20 thousand had died in Mississippi valley itself .
Naturopathy is a medical-philosophy .
The basis of treatment of diseases and health recuperation under naturopathy is - the natural strength of the body to fight disease molecules .
There are several methods under naturopathy . such as - water therapy , homeopathy , sun therapy , acupuncture , acupressure , soil therapy etc .
The contribution of several medical therapies are there in the propagation of naturopathy . such as the Ayurveda of India and the Nature Cure of Europe .
Naturopathy is a creative method of treatment , the goal of which is to end the root cause of disease with the use of available elements .
This is not just a treatment method but a life style according to the internal important powers or natural elements present in the human body .
In this natural treatment method natural food , specially fresh fruits and raw or lightly cooked vegetables play conclusive role in the treatment of different diseases .
Naturopathy is a total revolution in life style and science .
Naturopathy is a special boon for the poor persons and the poor nations .
Abnormal state of any part of skin is called skin disease .
Skin is the biggest system of the body .
This occurs due to direct contact with external environment .
Besides this the diseases of several other systems of parts -LRB- such as piles -RRB- are expressed through the skin itself .
Chikungunya is a long extending disease of the joints .
A great pain occurs in the joints in Chikungunya .
The aggressive stage of Chikungunya goes on for 2 to 5 days only but the pain of joints continue for months or weeks .
Chikununya virus is an arbovirus that is considered to be of the family of alphavirus .
Chikungunia enters into human through the bite of aedes mosquito .
It takes 2 to 4 days for Chikungunia to spread after entering into body .
The patients of Chikungunia can have acute joint pain for a long time that depends on their age .
Chikungunia disease spreads in the cycle of human-mosquito-human .
The virus of chikungunia is found mainly in monkeys but other species including humans can also be affected from it .
The most effective way of safety from the disease of chikungunia is to escape coming in contact with disease carrying mosquitoes .
There is no treatment for chikungunia nor is there any vaccine available against it .
Chloroquine is proving effective against the symptoms of chikungunia .
Kidney stones is a disease of the urinary system in which small stone like hard things form inside the kidney .
Generally these stones are flushed out from the body through the urinary passage .
But if they grow enough -LRB- 2-3 mm in size -RRB- then these can create blockage in the urinary tract .
Stone is found normally in the people of the age of 30 to 60 years .
Stone is found four times more among men than in women .
Stone of bladder forms more in children and old people while in adults stone form mostly in kidney and urinary tract .
The most regrettable thing is that only a few percent patients of stone get it treated .
The patients having diabetes have a good chance of catching the disease of kidney .
If a patient has the disease of blood pressure then he should pay attention on controlling blood pressure with regular medicine .
Because if blood pressure increases kidneys may also malfunction .
State of pain in case of stone in kidney .
In stone a sudden pain occurs in the lower part of the back or abdomen which goes up to the joint of the abdomen and thighs .
The pain of stone stays for some minutes or hours and relief comes intermittently .
There can also be complaint of nausea along with pain and vomiting .
If there is an infection in a part related to urinary system then fever , shivering , perspiration , pain along with urine etc . may also be included in the symptoms .
Blood also may come in urine .
Most of the patients of stone in kidney complain of acute pain starting from towards the abdomen .
This pain arises intermittently and stays for from a few minutes till several hours , this is called renal chronine .
The chief symptom of stone disease is that in it the pain starts from the lower part of the back and goes towards thighs .
Stone of the kidneys are diagnosed by complete medical test , X-ray-sonography , dye injection or ultrasound tests .
Some solutions of safety from stone .
Drink plenty of water so that 2 to 2 . litre of urine forms everyday .
There should be less amount of protein , nitrogen and sodium in diet .
Do not take such materials which has more amount of oxalate . such as chocolate , soyabean , almond , spinach etc .
Avoid Coca-Cola and other such beverages .
Heavy amount of vitamin-C should not be taken .
The danger of stone is less with the juice of orange etc .
Different kinds of stones , some out of which are made of calcium and some of uric acid .
The meaning of organ transplant is to transplant a healthy and functional organ from a body in the place of a damaged or unsuccessful part of another body .
Transplanting an organ of a patient into another organ of the same patient also comes under the category of organ transplant .
Organ donator can be both alive or dead .
Among the transplantable organs are included heart , kidney , liver , lungs , pancreas , penis , eyes and intestine .
Transplantation medicine is one of the most challenging and complex areas of modern medical discipline .
Unacceptance of transplanted organ by the body is among some of the biggest problems of the medical management area .
Where the immune system of the body rejects the transplanted organ by reacting against it and because of this transplant becomes unsuccessful and now a big challenge for the transplant medicine is to keep the transplanted organ active in the same body .
Transplantation is a very time sensitive process .
Bones , tendons , cornea , heart valves , veins , arm and skin are included among the tissues that can be transplanted .
There is a lack of suitable organs for transplant in most of the countries .
There is a formal system to alleviate risks of unacceptance and to manage allocation in most of the countries .
Some countries are attached to international organizations such as Eurotransplant so that the supply of organs can be assured .
Transplantation also brings some life ethical issues to the fore such as definition of death , when and how an agreement is to be given for an organ and payment for the used organ in transplant .
Amoeba dysentry disease emerges from a special kind of microbic bacteria called Entamoeba histolytica .
Entamoeba is present in the large intestine of the body in two forms .
These forms are called cyst and ova .
Humans takes it inside the body in the form of cyst through food items and beverages .
This cyst sometimes takes the form of eggs on entering the large intestine .
Among the main symptoms of dysentery patient has diarrhoea along with an acute form of stomach ache and an acute convulsion occurs near the anus .
On diagnosing such patients a tenderness is found in caecum and the left iliac region and some fever also occurs .
Flies are extremely helpful in spreading dysentery .
Toilet occurs 12 to 24 times or more a day and most of the part of the excreta is mucus and thickened blood .
Sometimes this amoeba enters the portal vein and creates epatitis and abscess blisters .
Abscess is a serious type of fatal disease .
When the abscess blasts then as a result its pus creates several fatal diseases on entering lungs , stomach , large intestine , peritoneum and pericardium .
Among the main symptoms of abscess there is an acute pain in the liver part of the patient which sometimes spreads to the right shoulder .
Besides this headache , shivering and fever also reach their pinnacle .
Patient feels acute pain and burn on just touching the liver part and the skin above it becomes sensitive .
To avoid abscess all the food items and beverages should be kept away from flies .
The person from whose excreta the cyst comes out should not do any work of the kitchen until blood and phlegm has stopped coming through excreta .
The patient of dysentery should eat barley .
If the power of eyes is more then one should wear contact lens .
Contact lens should be of high quality .
Washing eyes regularly is a good habit .
When the mucus has stopped coming out then the patient of dysentery can be given thin tapioca pearls -LRB- sabudana -RRB- arrowroot , rice , curd etc .
For good health of the eyes one should have vitamin-A rich diet .
The health of eyes remain good with regular yoga as well .
Your eyes are priceless , protect it .
Complete it .
The most common tumors found in women are swelling of the uterus glands , fibroid or leiomyoma .
This knot is found in approximately 30 to 40 % women .
This fact has come forward from regular sonography .
In many cases this does not produce any symptoms but in many cases this becomes reason for pain , bleeding and infertility .
Predominantly this is seen in women of 30 - 40 years of age .
Young girls also get infested with this at times .
The size of the swelling decreases after menopause .
But after taking hormone therapy the size may increase again .
This disease is found more in women of dark complexion in comparison to women of fair complexion .
The possibility of the occurrence of this increases if there are no or few children .
This disease is seen less also in women who use pills for family planning .
The danger of fibroid increases in menarche at young age .
If mother , sister etc . in the family have fibroid tumor then the possibility of the occurrence of this increases .
The danger also increases with the consumption of alcohol , cigarette and meat .
Vegetarianism helps in being saved from fibroid .
This is the tumor of muscles and fibrous tissues .
Approximately 20 - 30 % fibroids are symptom less .
Unusual , excessive bleeding , pain during menses .
Pain in abdomen , pain of waist .
Infertility due to knot inside uterus .
Symptoms due to pressure - difficulty in micturition .
Need of delivery with operation .
Anemia due to excessive bleeding post - delivery .
Difficulties occur many times in the cure of fibroid .
The uterus also increases in ovarian tumor - endometriosis , pregnancy adenomyosis etc .
Important tests .
Sonography , through abdomen and vagina .
The presence of swelling glands only is not a prerequisite for its removal .
If the submucos fibroid is small then it can be removed through hysteroscopic uterine endoscopy .
The submucos fibroid can also be removed with laser .
Before the removal of intramural fibroid it is seen what is the age of the woman , whether there are children or not , whether the family is complete or not , what does the female want .
Myomectomy operation can be carried out through hysteroscopy or laparoscopy or laprotomy -LRB- opening the abdomen -RRB- .
Only the tumor is taken out in case of young women who do not want more children .
If the age is not less , the tumor is quite big and there is no need for children then the whole uterus is removed together with the knot , hysterectomy .
By putting a pipe through the thigh artery in laparoscopic myolysis , the uterine artery is blocked by putting poly vinyl and gel foam particles .
The supply of blood reaching the swelling glands gets stopped through this and the swelling glands reduce up to 60 % .
Breast cancer is a dreadful name for women .
Thousands of deaths occur due to cancer being not recognized in initial days .
In cancer maximum people break down mentally and financially .
If breast cancer is recognized in the initial condition itself then its treatment is possible without any physical deformity .
At the same time cent percent patients can be ridden from the disease also .
Thus lacs of women and families can be saved from mental and financial agony .
In present times due to changes in social and living habits etc cancer is spreading very fast .
Till date many methods of cancer test like mammography , MRI , CT scan etc are helpful though but somehow or the other the side effects of radiation is seen in these .
In this condition the doctors have got hold of a new weapon - infrared thermography .
In infrared thermography , breast cancer due to ill effects of lethal radiation can be tested as fast as possible .
Greek and Egyptian doctors were aware of the disease of breast cancer and temperature of the body .
Sir William Harchell discovered infrared and thermal radiations in 1800 AD .
But till 1970 it was not certain that infrared could be used in the field of medicine .
Breast thermography helps in the detection of cancer in its very initial days .
Lacs of women can be benefitted from breast thermography .
The use of infrared thermography can be done in the detection of arteries being narrow as well etc . in diabetes .
If there is swelling in brain , brain tumor or meningitis in brain then the pressure of intracranial veins increases .
If there is rheumatoid arthritis or spondilitis then swelling occurs in eyes .
The effect of blood pressure on eyes is huge .
Due to blood pressure the veins of the eyes may be blocked or else bleeding can occur .
Due to this the eye sight may go even .
All the diseases of kidney and head can be diagnosed through eyes easily .
Anything altered on eyes has direct impact on kidney .
How much diabetes damages our body , even this can be diagnosed through eyes alone .
By taking the medicine chloroquine , the eye sight can completely go .
Eye sight can weaken due to Viagra .
If someone has diabetes then he must go to the doctor even if there is no eye problem .
The eyes of children after four years must be tested .
If there is any problem in his eyes then that can be corrected with this .
In small kids if there is any complaint of eye squint then many times it can be corrected even without surgery .
With age the eyes should certainly be tested at least once in a year .
If having vision syndrome then the person must get the check up done continuously .
Do not put any medicine in the eyes without consulting the doctor .
If anyone 's paternal uncle , maternal uncle , father or mother have cataract then the check up must be done regularly .
Due to cataract the pressure of the eyes can increase because of which the veins can be spoiled .
Many times cataract comes fast in the eyes .
Never look towards sun with naked eyes .
There is always a need to protect eyes from the ultraviolet rays of the sun .
The eye sight does not increase by walking on green grass .

The newest alternative in knee implant is rotating platform high flexion knee , due to which in all activities like walking , bending during gardening , sitting for driving or exercising , climbing down the stairs the patient gets comfort .
