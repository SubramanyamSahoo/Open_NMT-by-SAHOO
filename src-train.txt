The treatment of cataract is possible through surgery only .
Complete lens capsule is taken out in the method of Intra Capsular Cataract Extraction , after the operation spectacles are used post-test .
During operation lens is implanted at front of the iris , the frontal part of the eye .
In the Extra Capsular Cataract Method , the part of the frontal capsule and the whole of the lens matter is extracted and the posterior part of the capsule is left intact .
Lens is fitted in the capsular bag .
In the S . . . . -LRB- Small Incision Cataract Surgery -RRB- method . 6 mm tunnel is formed while the rest of the method follows like that of the ECCE-IOL .
No stitches are applied in the S . . . . -LRB- Small Incision Cataract Surgery -RRB- method .
In black cataract the eye nerves dilapidates gradually . It happens due to extra water pressure in the eye or because of not enough blood reaching in the eye nerves .
The blindness caused by the black cataract can be prevented if it is identified soon and its regular treatment and tests continue .
When the extra pressure is more in the eyes .
If somebody suffers from black cataract in the family .
In most of the patients the part of the water channel from the eyes are open yet for some reasons the water gets lessened .
Internal pressure keeps on increasing and the eye nerves dilapidates , gradually the patient can not see things around , eyesight might also be lost if treatment is not done in time .
Main symptoms on appearance of which a patient should consult a doctor .
Seeing rainbow like colorful ovals in light .
We will check the eye nerves with special lens or equipment to find how much of damage has occurred .
Field test , in which the capacity to see things on the sides while looking straight is tested .
The part -LRB- angle -RRB- from where the water passes out can be seen through a special lens .
With the lack of vitamin-A the cornea becomes weak and a wound appears through which at last causes blindness .
The lack of vitamin-A is even more imminent in states of measles and malnutrition .

Cancer is a lifestyle generated disease .
Cancer erupts by our wrong practices , thoughts , behavior and diet .
Smoking excessive cigarette causes more of windpipe cancer .
We progress towards development and getting rid of diseases .
Due to changes in our lifestyle the number of cancer and heart patients are increasing .
This disease is number one in Japan . In developed countries , this disease in at number 2 and in developing countries this disease is at number 3 .
One out of every eight persons can at any time become victim of cancer .
This disease found in different types at different locations in our country due to difference in the lifestyle , customs and religion .
All the data in the country has been calculated . Ovarian cancer and breast cancer is found in 40 percent of the women in cities .
It is between 60 and 65 percent among the rural women .
Lungs and breathing pipe cancer is found more due to smoking and pollution and the possibility of cancer of the mouth and stomach is more with gutkha , pan parag , tobacco and tobacco powder .
What is cancer .
Cancer is name of a disease .
In cancer cells multiply by itself and ignores the rules of the body .
Cells also reach other parts of the body .
Cell takes the form of a cyst or wound , and destroys all the systems coming in contact with it .
Cancer is a group of more than 1000 diseases .
Although each of the disease is different from the other but basically all the types of cancers occurs as a result of anomaly in some cells .
Generally , easy tumors can be weeded out through surgery and there is no possibility of its coming up again .
Difficult tumors are cancer .
Difficult tumors can destroy nearby tissues and parts .
Cancer cells can spread into other areas through which new tumors can get born .
As cancer can spread , it is necessary that the doctor should immediately find whether the tumor is formed and that it is cancer .
The treatment of cancer can start as soon as it is found .
Several symptoms shows up due to cancer that gives the impressions of cancer .
Details of some important symptoms are given below .
If there is an oxalate stone in the kidney what preventions could be advantageous .
Any wound that do not heal in enough time .
Cyst or swelling on breast or any other part of the body .
Abnormal passing of blood or pus from any part or organ of body .
Continuous prolonged bouts of cough or occurrence of heaviness in speech .
Pain in swallowing food or during toilet , continuous indigestion or constipation .
Change in general habits of bowels .
Sudden change in the size , color or shape of moles or warts .
However , such symptoms erupts not just because of cancer , there can be other reasons as well for these .
Therefore one should not take it as cancer just on its appearance .
Show these to the doctor if these symptoms stay for two weeks .
There is no doubt that immediate identification of most of the cancer diseases -LRB- 60-70 percent -RRB- is possible .
The need is to increase the knowledge about it and for every one to take care of oneself .
After identifying cancer early , total treatment is now possible for 60-70 percent of cancer patients .
Not only this , the cost of early identification and immediate treatment is also much lower than late treatment .
Besides being aware of the symptoms of cancer , all the men and the women should get themselves tested regularly .
Some types of cancers can be identified by general tests before any symptoms appear .
Doctors can find out cancer diseases of mouth , breast , cervix , skin , large intestine , rectum , prostate gland , testicle etc . even before any signs appear .
Cancer of the cervix is a common cancer of occurring among women .
Among all the cancers occurring in India 40 percent is that of cervix .
Lymph nodes are connected to lymph arteries and form a white liquid that is called lymph .
The web of lymph arteries is spread throughout the body like blood arteries .
Lymph nodes try to keep cancer cells to itself by filtering them .
On advancement of the cancer it is not able to do this and cancer spreads from one part of the body to other part by lymph .
That is why surgeons usually weed out the lymph nodes nearby the cervix also .
Cervical cancer can spread through blood circulation .
For changes in skin , particularly any kind of growth in moles or warts , you should get tested regularly .
Any kind of changes should be shown to the doctor immediately .
A doctor should also test the skin during general medical check-up .
Regular medical check-up is important for early detection of cancer of the large intestine and the rectum .
A doctor can find out about the disease by inserting gloved finger in the rectum .
Annual test of everybody after the age of 50 years is necessary .
Blood can occur with the faeces due to cancer of the large intestine .
A comprehensive test is mandatory for confirmed diagnosis . The doctor should do a sigmoidoscopy -LRB- telescopic test of the rectum -RRB- of the rectum and the large intestine in a period of 3 to 5 years for persons crossing the age of 50 years .
The most credible method of finding out the prostate cancer in its initial stage is the test of gloved finger by the doctor .
An annual check-up of everybody above the age of 40 years must be done .
With annual test any irregular or abnormal areas can be found out and it can be known whether there is a tumor or not .
Testicular gland cancer could be found out by most of the men themselves .
Men can find out any changes in the testicular gland by testing themselves every month .
The best time to test it is during the time of bathing with hot water or after , when the testicle is flaccid , as in this situation any changes can be easily figured out .
While testing the testicular gland by oneself , if one finds a swelling , cyst or any other kind of defect , particularly an abnormal pain on touching the testicular gland , pain or heaviness , then the doctor should consulted .
Testicular gland test should also be a part of the regular annual medical test of the humans by the doctors .
Regular test of mouth is required for the signs of mouth cancer .
Change of tissues of mouth can be the initial stage of cancer .
Change of tissues of mouth can be easily seen and experienced .
A dentist should test the mouth of every patient in every form .
Changes occurring in gum , lips and cheek should be paid attention .
Scab cracks , swelling , bleeding or cyst or tumor in any part of the mouth should be paid special attention .
You must get tested by a doctor or a dentist .
If you are eating tobacco , betel , pan masala or zarda then the test is even more essential .
You can also view your mouth in the mirror and in case of any changes , you can take advice of the doctor .
All the women should know how to test their own breasts and each month they should test their breasts themselves .
It is good to test the breasts a few days after the menstruation period when there is no possibility of breasts becoming large or any pains at all .
Even if the menstruation period has stopped , women should appoint a day -LRB- whenever -RRB- each month for test .
This test is specially important for women above the age of 40 years .
The danger of breast cancer increases in age above 40 years .
If a woman feels a cyst or any kind of change in the breasts she should consult a doctor .
About 80 percent of the cysts of the breasts are not cancer but only a doctor can correctly find it out .
Any abnormal situations like cyst in the breasts or breasts becoming very large must be tested during the medical test of women .
After the age of 40 years every women must get mammogram done in 1 to 2 years .
If the age of women goes up to 50 years then mammogram should be done every year .
The women whose mothers , sister , blood aunts etc . have cancer should start getting mammography done since 25-30 years .
Cancer is tested through pathology .
It is seen in microscope .
Cancer can be found out through other tests like X-ray . . . Scan . . . . ultrasound also .
List of training test centres where cancer can be tested .
Surgery depends on the stage of the cancer .
If cancer is in a limited area and in initial stage then along with the affected area some normal areas are also extracted .
It is attempted that no particle of cancer is left out .
If cancer has also entered other areas then surgery is done to lessen the size of the cancer .
Cancer cells are burnt through laser .
Before laser , calculation of area of cancer , spread , capacity of the patient , time of laser based on the cancer , stage , area strength is done .
Then a mark applied on the skin .
Entry for any other person is prohibited in that room during the laser .
There is no pain in radioactive rays .
Sometimes the skin may become red or patient may feel like vomiting .
Some cancers like blood cancer and the cancer of the cysts can be fully treated with medicine .
These medicines destroy the cancer cells .
General cells may also be affected with these medicines .
Nails may fall .
There might occur a decrement in blood which may cause tiredness .
If the patient takes medicine in regular cycle and eats healthy food he can recover fully .
During the treatment blood should be tested regularly , one should have clean water and clean food .
One should not sit with a sick person because the immune strength gets very lessened with medicines .
Incurable cancer patients are kept in palliative care so that their physical , mental pain could be lessened .
List of hospitals where the treatment of cancer is available .
Awareness and prevention from cancer .
Prevention from tobacco and tobacco related products and quitting control .

Information related to cancer , its symptoms , harms of tobacco , self-breast test and prevention has been given in Junior High Schools .
All the hospitals , Superintendant Base hospital , district hospital , women hospital , medical college and private hospitals in the state have been asked to maintain a cancer register .
They will register cancer patients coming to their outdoor department and post this report to the directorate every month .
We will find out what is the number of cancer patients in the state and in which area which cancer has been found more .
Chicken pox -LRB- varicella -RRB- .
Chicken pox is a viral that erupts out of a contact with varicella zoster -LRB- VZV -RRB- .
Fever and eruption of a special kind of papules is the sign of chicken pox .
A virus spreads from one person to another person through air born drops .
It erupts through the spread of the spray of saliva in the nearby environment on sneezing or coughing of a person infected with chicken pox .
It can also spread through a direct contact with chicken pox or herpes because there is contagious liquid in raw wounds .
In some cases it can also spread from an infected pregnant mother to the unborn or to a new born baby .
Chicken pox is the most contagious a few days before the papules erupt and before the scab spreads over the wounds i . . till it dries up which often happens a week after the spots have started .
Fever , shivering , nausea and vomiting are the most clear and famous symptoms , eruption of blisters and extreme itching freckles .
In most of the children 200-300 blisters erupt that later become scabs .
Chicken pox can attack both young and adult , men and women .
Most of the people become victim of chicken pox one time or the other in their childhood or adolescence .
But if adults who had never been a victim of chicken pox come into contact with such a case , they are in danger of contraction and they may suffer from chicken pox in adulthood .
Chicken pox is more serious in adolescents and adults in comparison with children .
Fever stays for a longer time .
Keeping infected persons away from school or work helps in decreasing the spread of the virus but vaccination is an effective solution to escape the pain of chicken pox .
Fever is estimated with symptoms like high fever , acute body pain , headache , joint pain , eye pain and finding of papules on body .
Besides the above general symptoms , complaints of bleeding from teeth , mouth or nose also occur in serious patients of chicken pox .
Tourniquet test comes positive in chicken pox patients and platelet count is found less than 1 lac on blood test .
Dengue fever occurs after a sting of aedes aegypti .
Aedes aegypti is also known by the name of tiger mosquito and it stings during the day time .

Diabetes is such a kind of disease as a result of which sugar becomes very high in blood .
Diabetes is a serious disease which , if not controlled , can be killing .
On being under attack of diabetes our body forms insulin which helps in lessening sugar .
Sugar increases in the blood with lack of insulin .
If you have the following symptoms then you may have diabetes .
Frequent feeling of urination .
Feeling more thirsty and dim vision .
Physical inability in sexual activities .
Numbness in feet or paralysing feeling in them .
Problems occurring from diabetes .
The following problems and complexities can emerge from diabetes .
Excess of sugar in blood , long term complexities .
Damage to tendons or neuropathy .
Damage to kidney or nephropathy .
Damage to eyes or retinopathy .
Disease and contraction of heart and blood vessels .
Long term complexities of diabetes .
damage to tendons : diabetes damages the tendons of feet and hands .
Shivering , numbness , inflammation or pain may occur due to damage to the tendons which often starts from the tip of the fingers of your feet or hands and increases gradually upwards .
If treatment is not done then you can lose the power of feeling in the affected organs .
Damage to kidney : Delicate filtering system present in the kidney may be damaged with diabetes by which kidneys may stop working and dialysis or kidney transplantation may be required .
Diabetes may damage the retina of your eyes which may cause blindness .
Disease of heart and blood vessels : The main complexity of diabetes is the damage of heart and blood vessels by which heart attack , paralysis and defect in blood circulation may occur .
Studies have proved that dangers of heart attack and paralysis is more among the people with diabetes than those who do not have diabetes .
Excess of sugar in the infected blood decreases your immune strength and the danger of infection increases by this .
Your mouth , gums , lungs , skin , feet , kidney , bladder and the areas of reproductive organs , all of them can be easily affected with contagion .
Dangers of diabetes related complexities can be decreased to a great extent with the control of sugar in the blood and adopting healthy lifestyle .
The chances of bringing the situation back to the pre-damage stage or minimizing it increases by finding out the complexities early through regular medical tests .
Every disease occurs due to a type of virus .
Virus is so small that they can not be seen through common microscope .
If polluted mosquito bites a person then the virus enters into the body of that person .
After about 4 to 14 days the symptoms of disease start appearing in that person .
Usually the following symptoms are found in the patients of diabetes .
High fever .
Acute pain .
Stiffness in neck .
Stiffness in body .
Strokes in body .
Nausea and vomiting .
Fainting or total nervousness .
As soon as the above mentioned symptoms appear the patient should immediately be admitted for treatment at the nearby primary health center , sub-divisional government hospital or district hospital .
Malaria spreads through mosquitoes therefore it is necessary that the number of mosquitoes be decreased in community .
Disease carrying mosquitoes mainly reside outside home in paddy fields , ponds and ditches filled with water .
Pay special attention towards cleanliness at home and outside .
Fill the ditches , cut tall grass and bushes .
Wear pants , pyjama , dhoti , socks , full sleeved kurta or shirt in the evening .
Use mosquito nets while sleeping wherever possible .
Do not let rain water collect near the ditches nearby house .
Cooperate with the health staffs in sprinkling insecticides and fogging .
Use fine nets to stop mosquitoes enter the pigsties .
Get the vaccine of encephalitis administered in time .
Hepatitis-A is one of the most widespread disease spreading in the whole world .
This occurs due to Hepatitis-A virus and it is common at places with bad level of cleanliness .
Virus attacks lever and causes diseases of different intensity to emerge in the patients .
Hepatitis-A viral spreads in the faeces and at first it spreads through the anal passage .
The virus comparatively takes long time to show symptoms and is contagious .
Therefore the infected person can spread the disease to other people even before it develops .
Nausea , jaundice , purge , light colored faeces , stomach ache , weakness , tiredness , fever , shivering , not feeling hungry , neck pain etc .
Symptoms are dependent on the frequency of emergence .
Hepatitis-A and V are two different kinds of viral hepatitis that occur due to different kinds of viruses .
Every type of hepatitis is different .
Hepatitis-A can not be avoided with the vaccination of hepatitis-B .
Similarly , hepatitis-B can not be avoided with the vaccination of hepatitis-A .
The vaccine is available now and is the most practical solution against hepatitis-A .
Primary vaccination keeps a person safe for a year and the booster dose administered after six months gives safety for about 20 years .
A combined vaccine is available from Glaxosmithkline which provides safety from , both hepatitis-A and hepatitis-B through a single safety order administered at 0 . . months .
The combined vaccine of hepatitis-A and hepatitis-B is available in two forms .
Paediatric dose : One dose is of 0 . ml for children and adolescents .
Adult dose : The dose is of 1 . ml for adults of the age of 16 years and above .
Hepatitis-B is a worldwide disease which occurs due to hepatitis-B virus -LRB- HBV -RRB- .
HBV affects mainly liver by which an inflammation occurs .
The cells of liver gets destroyed and the function of liver often gets interrupted .
The results of infection are different and unexpected .
The results of infection are dependent on the age of patient and state of the capacity of the immune system .
Hepatitis-B is extremely contagious and it is thought to be 100 times more contagious than the HIV .
In comparison with AIDS , Hepatitis-B victimises more people to death in the whole year .
Blood is the most important vehicle in the spread of hepatitis-B disease but it can also spread through other body fluids in which sperm , vaginal fluids and saliva are included .
HBV spreads in three ways , from mother to child , at birth time and from person to person .
The most effective and convenient solution for safety from hepatitis-B and its resultant chronic carrier state or liver cancer is vaccination .
After vaccination people who have developed protective anti-bacterial reactions can get total safety from intense and old contraction along with diseases .
With extensive use of hepatitis-B vaccination a remarkable decrease has been seen in hepatitis-B infection and the liver cancer arising out of long term hepatitis-B .
Yellow fever is also called yellow jack , black vomit , Negro 's vomit or American Plague .
The combined vaccine is made for children and adults .
What precautions should be taken after operation so that hernia does not occur again .
The huge problem of increasing population has stayed in India after independence .
The family welfare program was run at the national level in the year of 1952 .
On the subject of population and development it was suggested at an international conference in Cairo -LRB- Egypt -RRB- in the year of 1994 that it would be necessary for human welfare and development to conjugate reproductive health safety along with reforms to family welfare .
All the reproduction health safety should be kept in the form of a single element within family planning services .
Therefore the concept of Reproductive and Child Health Programme was born .
Reproductive and Child Health Programme is being run since the year of 1997 in India .
This program has been running in Uttarakhand since the constitution of the state .
Reproduction rate has always been low in Uttarakhand in comparison with the original state Uttar Pradesh .
Raw birth rate of this state in the period of 1951-1956 was 48 which decreased to become 35 in the period of 1976-1981 and during the years of 1994-2001 this rate lowered more and stayed at 26 only .
Among the districts this rate is the least in Paudi while the most in Haridwar .
Gross reproduction rate -LRB- the number of infants given birth by a woman in her life time -RRB- which was estimated to be more than 5 for the period of 1971-76 , has been continuously decreasing and in the year of 2001 this number was 3 . .
Inter district differences has also occurred less during this period .
Raw birth rate and gross reproduction rate has been different in urban and rural areas .
It is the desire of son that will affect the future reproductive level of the state .
Generally , birth rate is lower the hilly areas than in the plain areas .
About one fourth of the women give birth to the next child within 24 months .
A little less than half of the mothers -LRB- 46 percent -RRB- give birth to more than 3 kids .
About 42 percent of the births come in the category of serious danger .
It is difficult to comment on the tendencies and styles of the decrement in the death rate due to lack of information on death rate related to Uttarakhand in particular .
According to the estimates of Sample Registration System -LRB- S . . . -RRB- the death rate was estimated 7 on the population of every 1000 during the year of 2000 which is lower than the national average of 9 .
The infant mortality rate of the state was 50 every 1000 live births in the year of 2000 which is very less than the national rate -LRB- 68 -RRB- .
Two third deaths out of the total infant mortality number occurs during the period of infancy itself .
Infant mortality rate in Uttarakhand is 19 per 1000 live births .
Data related to maternal mortality rate of the state is not available .
Considering odd physical situations of the state it can be said that the maternal mortality rate in the state would be very high .
Non-communicable disease is becoming a big cause of death with changes occurring in the life style due to modernization and urbanization .
The goal of Reproductive and Child Health Welfare Programme is to bring about decline in the maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate .
This program is being run to give special importance to the participation of men with relation to Reproductive and Child Health Welfare Programme , to provide complete knowledge of protected and effective contraceptive methods to men and women , to make medical facilities available to the pregnant women during pregnancy and to help parents get healthy new born babies .
The goal of health programs is to increase the rate of parent security to 49 . percent till 2006 , 55 . percent till 2010 , and 95 percent till 2020 .
The rate of childbirth security to 60 percent till 2006 , 80 percent till 2010 and institutional childbirths has increased to the maximum .
Main works under the Reproductive and Child Health Programme .
Main works being run under the program are as follows .
Organisation of R . . . camps .
Organisation of R . . . Outdoor sessions .
Appointment of women health workers on contract .
Comprehensive construction work and repairing of health units .
Urban Reproductive and Child Health Programme .
Appointment of supplementary A . . . on contract .
Appointment of 258 supplementary A . . . on contract basis in the unserved and rural areas has been made to increase the immunisation of mothers and children and the acceptability of contraceptives .
On the directions of the Government of India service is being made available at 39 PHCs and 26 CHCs with the goal to provide secure childbirth from 8 o'clock at night to 7 o'clock in the morning at PHCs and CHCs .
900 untrained midwives have been trained in Uttarakhand in the year of 2001-2002 and 2002-03 to provide services of safe labor to pregnant mothers .
560 untrained midwives have been trained in the year of 2004-2005 .
5 Safe Maternity Counsellors -LRB- Women Medical Officer -RRB- were accepted to be appointed by the Government of India on a contract basis under the E . . . scheme .
After the advertisements in newspapers for appointment three women medical officers were selected out of which only 1 women medical officer has reported her contribution at Agastyamuni CHC of district Rudraprayag .
Care of the health of women and children and vaccination is being done on a village council level by organising an Outreach Session on a defined day -LRB- Saturday -RRB- by women health workers at the level of each village council in the state .
The said program has been scrapped by the Govt . of India since July , 2004 .
But the above mentioned program is being run in the state with the help of women health workers .
Medicines are being bought at the state level under the RCH program .
RCH kits are being provided directly to the districts by the Government of India .
For equipments bought at the level of the state the provision is to purchase after the recommendation of the Executive Committee constituted at the state level by the Purchase Committee constituted at the level of the Head Office .
Special work has been done in districts in the year of 2003-2004 for propagation of NSV -LRB- without cut , without stitch -RRB- method to increase the participation men in population stabilisation .
Population stabilisation , installation of stable RN hoarding , wall paintings , orientation of the members of the Panchayati Raj and medical and paramedical staff from the medical department and other media exhibition etc . were done .
Leprosy is a bacteria born contagious disease .
The name of this bacteria is microbacterium leprae .
Microbacterium leprae affects mainly the nervous system and the skin .
Incubation period of leprosy is three years on an average and this disease grows very slowly .
Leprosy can affect persons of any age and sex equally .
The M . . . medicine cures the patient completely by eradicating the leprosy bacteria and prevents the disease from spreading in the society .
All the leprosy patients are not contagious .
Most of the patients are non-contagious who can not spread the disease , only 15 to 20 percent patients are contagious .
Leprosy is comparatively much less contagious than other diseases such as measles . . . etc .
About 95 percent of the people have the resistance capability to fight leprosy thereby this disease can not happen to them .
The main symptoms and identification of leprosy are as follows .
A light yellow or discolored reddish spot or stain on skin of the body that has numbness . . . the spot has no feeling of pain , inflammation , itching or piercing or cold and hot .
Oily shine on the skin .
Thickness of cyst on skin , eyebrows , chin , ears .
Do not do any hard work for three months after the operation of hernia .
Thrilling sensation , numbness or dryness in hands or feet .
Occurrence of deformation in the fingers of hands or feet .
Initiation and spread of leprosy .
Leprosy often starts with a spot or freckle on the body that is numb .
If this gets treated in the initial stage then the disease is cured completely and the disability does not get aroused in it that is the main reason of social excommunication .
If the treatment is not done due to careless or lack of right information about leprosy then the disease keeps on growing .
Fingers start becoming malformed , wounds erupt in hands and feet and the face starts looking ugly .
Most of the people reach the doctor for advice in this stage .
Wounds and ulcer form because of no care for the numb and insensitive parts of the leprosy patients .
Complete treatment is possible even in the stage of wound and ulcer but the disability and deformity that occurred due to lateness in treatment can not be brought back to the previous state through medicines .
Yes , the hands and feet of the disabled person can be formed in such a way through simple operations so that the patient can work again and run his livelihood .
Malaria spreads through the bite of female anopheles mosquito .
Female anopheles mosquitoes get born in clean water and bites at night .
Fever along with shivering and cold comes often the third day .
You must change water collected in pots at home once a week .
Use mosquito nets while sleeping or apply mustard oil on open parts of the body .
Install fine nets on windows of house .
Do not let water collect near yourself .
If this is not possible then pour some petro-lubricants oil on the collected water .
The disease of measles can take a very serious form in developing countries because the death rate due to this is more than 10 percent .
Therefore it is recommended to administer its vaccination to the children at the earliest possible .
Besides the antibody level of mothers and doses of vaccination , considering the incidents of the disease it is recommended by the World Health Organisation to administer the vaccine of measles to the children at the age of nine months .
Among the indications and symptoms of measles are included - fever , common symptoms of cold , conjunctivitis , cough , stains inside mouths and the red papules erupting on the skin .
Besides this , loose motion , stomach ache and lack of hunger like symptoms may also be show up during the contraction .
In comparison with children the symptoms of measles shows up more seriously in adolescents , its incubation period is about 10-12 days and almost no symptoms of this disease shows up from outside during this period .
During the period of 10 to 12 days , at first a local contraction occurs due to the virus in the breathing passage and then the contagion spreads into other parts of the body as well .
After this having spread through the whole of the blood circulation the virus takes the form of primary disease .
The period between the entrance of the bacteria and the start of the disease .
Mumps or contagious perotitis is a kind of serious contagious disease in which a swelling emerges in one or both of saliva glands near the jaws and starts paining .
Saliva glands are present inside the cheeks in front of the ears and respectively on the lower surface of the mouth .
Besides this , mouth also starts drying up due to mumps .
Rubella or German measles is also extremely contagious which occurs in children , adolescents and youths .
Rubella occurring immediately after birth is generally nominal and stays only for a while .
The most clear symptoms of rubella disease light red papules . The most important problem of this disease is that its virus grows very fast as a result of which birth defects occur in children .
About 25 to 50 percent of rubella contraction does not get known and when its symptoms emerge they are very light and shows up clearly .
When rubella occurs in adults then fever comes to them two days before the papules emerge and their hunger also gets lessened .
Live attenuated vaccines of measles , mumps and rubella are in the form an amalgamated single vaccine which is called MMR .
MMR vaccines are more effective because there are different related breed in this single virus vaccine .
The use of MMR vaccines has been extremely effective .
Immunisation power achieved with MMR stays for more time and almost throughout the life .
Start exercises three months after operation to keep muscles of stomach healthy .
However the goal of the first step taken for measles is execution of Primary Vaccination Programme .
The World Health Organisation believes that a single dose is not enough to eradicate measles .
Therefore now it is recommended by both W . . . and the UNICEF that besides giving its first dose at 9 months administration of second vaccine is also very necessary to protect these children from measles .
Disorder of the brain , that affects the capacity to think , understand , work or feel .
Such a system of brain is called mental disorder .
It is estimated that 1-2 percent of the population are afflicted with serious mental disease and about 5 percent are victims of common mental disease .
It is estimated that out of the outdoor patients coming to the hospitals 25 percent are mentally ill .
Mental disease can occur in several ways for as purblindness , epilepsy , sleeplessness , hypersomnia , change in copulation and copulation process , mood change , schizophrenia , dementia , delirium , change in personality .
Yellow fever is an extreme virus generated disease .
Yellow fever is a main disease is African and Latin American countries .
It is called yellow fever because in many of its patients symptoms of jaundice shows up .
Not paying attention to any work .
Being sad without any reason .
Getting angry very soon , very often .
Change in mood very soon , being sorry from happiness and getting happy again .
Getting disturbed soon by the small talk of children .
Thinking oneself as always correct and others wrong .
Emergence of desire to take tobacco , alcohol , cannabis , marijuana .
Problem in desire or the process of copulation .
Before declaring mental disorder for any patient his total mental agony is seen -LRB- in which present problems , old and new problems , family or problems near him can be seen -RRB- and then his physical and mental test is done .
If needed , lab tests of ECG , RFT , LFT , EEG and CT scan , diagnostic standardized intervenes and psychological test are done .
Treatment of mental diseases can be done through the following methods .
Listening to the patient and his family and providing information about his mental health .
Encouraging the patient to change emotionally .
Making people aware by propagating for mental health through press . . . radio , health fairs , posters , banners etc in every district .
Making social environment better , encouraging participation and social relations among people in the society .
Finding out about the mental , social and personality change since the start .
Running tests in schools , colleges , government and non-government institutes .
Treating emotional and mental disorders , enabling families to undergo difficult situations .
Solving the social and personal problems of the patient .
Treating the mental patient and lessening the difficulty of the family and society .
Saving a mental patient from falling ill again .
The following is be executed in the state under the mental health program .
State Mental Health Authority has been constituted in the state since 4 April , 2002 .
A 30 bed State Mental Hospital is being constructed at Dehradun under the Mental Health Authority program .
Two districts of Uttarakhand have been chosen under the District Mental Health Programme .
Dehradun in the Garhwal division and Nainital in the Kumaun division .
For which a proposal of 184 . 30 lac has been sent to the Government of India .
This program will be implemented in both the districts of Dehradun and Nainital .
The National Maternity Benefit Scheme has been transferred from Social Welfare Department to Health Welfare Department since 14 . . 2001 by the Government of India .
The process of transfer is now complete .
The National Maternity Benefit Scheme is being implemented by the Health Department in the state of Uttarakhand .
Under the National Maternity Benefit Scheme above 19 year old women living below the poverty line are given an assistance of Rs . 500 on first live delivery for proper nutrition .
The details of the capital received from the Government of India and the intended beneficiaries in 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 under the National Maternity Benefit Scheme are as follows .
The following programs are being run in the state of Uttarakhand under the Maternity and Infant Welfare Services .
A little less than half of the pregnant women are able to get pre-delivery tests done in Uttarakhand while this is 65 percent at the national level .
The percentage of the women getting the pre-delivery test done thrice is only 18 .
There is a huge difference in view of the numbers of women getting the advantage of pre-delivery services in the urban and the rural areas .
More than three fourth of the women -LRB- 78 percent -RRB- in the urban areas gets the pre-delivery test done at least once while a little more than one third of rural pregnant women do so .
A little more than one third -LRB- 39 percent -RRB- of the pregnant women take supplementary doses of iron folic acid pills .
In cases of tetanus toxide injection 54 percent of the pregnant women have got two or more than two injections of T . . however such women in the rural areas are 49 percent and in the urban areas 77 percent .
Generally there is much less vogue of pre-delivery services among uneducated mothers and in the families of low living standards , the following works are done mainly under this service .
Indicating pregnant women .
Distribution of pills to prevent anemia and referencing of proper cases of complex cases .
There are only 21 percent of institutional delivery in Uttarakhand .
This is 42 percent in cities while in rural areas more than 82 percent of labor occurs at home and out of these more than half of these conclude with the help of the midwives .
Even in urban areas more than half -LRB- 56 percent -RRB- of childbirths takes place at home .
In Uttarakhand about one fourth of the childbirths conclude with the help of doctors and about 10 percent with trained maids , assistant health workers and midwives .
Out of seven childbirths completing outside the medical institutions only one childbirth -LRB- 14 percent -RRB- is benefitted with post-labour tests within two months .
Safe childbirth and referencing of complex cases is mainly done under the post-childbirth services .
Care for mother and the newborn baby , referencing of complex cases , vaccination of babies , distribution of vitamin-A solution to protect children from blindness , proper advice and services for limited family and family planning and abortion .
A comparative detail of the achievements under maternity services till the year of 2001-2002 , 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 has been shown in the following table .
The disease called poliomyelitis occurs due to an extremely contagious virus which attacks only humans .
This contagious virus spreads generally through the medium of water or on coming in contact with infected person .
However this disease can also spread through mouth to mouth .
Polio disease particularly attacks young children .
80 to 90 percent of the cases of polio are often seen in children less than 3 years of age .
Polio is an extremely contagious disease .
Till the infection of one person in the family is known the possibility of contraction to other members also arises because this infection spreads rapidly , this virus spreads faster because of crowded places clean toilet facilities .
Oral Poliovirus Vaccine -LRB- OPV -RRB- was first used in the contemporary Soviet Union .
As a result of the technique developed in this country new methods of controlling or eradicating polio was discovered in other countries .
The most relevant proof of the great success of OPV is the Polio Eradication Programme being run throughout the world .
The Pulse Polio Programme run in India for polio eradication has also been very much successful .
Combined DTP vaccines have been used the world over since 1940 itself and great success has been achieved in lessening the clinical pertussis with its help .
By giving 3 doses of DTP vaccines to children they can be made protected against the disease like diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis .
Diphtheria is such a contagion that affects throat , mouth and nose .
Diphtheria is a contagious disease , easily contractible , but after its vaccine being developed it is found less very less .
Sex related diseases are contagious diseases . This disease gets communicated from the infected patient to one 's sex partner during sexual intercourse .
This is the reason that these diseases are called sexually transmitted diseases , their contraction is easy .
Contraction of sexually transmitted diseases is easy .
Sexually transmitted diseases are serious and painful .
The most found diseases of the sexually transmitted disease group are - gonorrhoea , herpes chlamydia .
Many sexually transmitted diseases show some symptoms initially , these symptoms end without any treatment .
Some sexual diseases specially in women create either common symptoms or no symptoms at all .
Person infected with sexual disease looks totally healthy but he can infect his sexual partner or unborn children .
Uncommon oozing or stench , pain below abdomen -LRB- between naval and the reproductive organs -RRB- .
Inflammation near vagina or pain in the depths of the vagina , symptoms both is men and women .
Wounds near reproductive organs , swelling or papules and crust in mouth , pain with inflammation in the urinary tract while urinating or excreting .
Fever , cold , body ache like in flu , swelling near reproductive organs .
If proper treatment of sexually infected diseases is not done then complexities may arise in them .
Dead birth due to inborn syphilis .
The birth of undeveloped baby may also occur due to contagious diseases .
Blindness in children due to gonorrhoea contraction .
Swelling in conjuctiva of the eye .
Contracted sexual behavior is the best method for safety from sexually generated disease .
The following directions could be helpful in sexually transmitted disease .
Do not copulate with the sexual partners who have papules , reddening , wound or inflammation in their reproductive organs .
Keep away from uncommon sexual relations .
Wash the reproductive organs immediately after sexual intercourse .
HIV contraction can also be lessened with safety from sexually generated diseases .
It is always right to do immediate treatment to stop spread of contraction in case of the occurrence of complexities .
Remember , encourage for regular tests if safe sexual behavior is not followed .
Most of the sexually generated disease get completely treated with proper treatment .
Tuberculosis is a contagious disease .
Tuberculosis occurs due to contraction of microbacterium tuberculosis .
The tuberculosis disease spreads through air from a tuberculosis patient to a healthy person and can happen to people of any age or sex .
A tuberculosis patient can infect 10-15 persons in a year .
About 1000 adults die everyday of tuberculosis in India which is much higher than the total number of deaths occurring due to all other diseases .
Tuberculosis can occur in any part of the body such as lungs , bones , joints or the sides of lymph nodes .
This disease is found commonly in the lungs .
In comparison to any other infected patients the youths die the most of the disease .
Because it is the youths who die the most of it therefore social and economic loss is much .
The quantity of tuberculosis in the society is too much . People are afraid to say about this and proper tests could not be get done .
In comparison to any other disease there are more orphans due to tuberculosis .
According to fresh research 3 lac children in India drop out of school due to this disease every year .
The maximum number of tuberculosis patients in the world are found in India .
Although the incidence of privilege rate is not available but studies state that the incidence rate is about 256 per lac .
In comparison to any other disease women die the most of tuberculosis in India .
The number of women dying of tuberculosis is more than the deaths caused by all other reasons combined .
This has been found in fresh studies that one lac women are thrown away from homes because of tuberculosis .
In comparison with healthy humans the danger of tuberculosis in HIV positive humans increases 5 times .
Tuberculosis infected patients should be treated with the DOTS strategy .
Coughs of 3 weeks or more is the chief symptom of tuberculosis -LRB- of the lungs -RRB- .
The easy way of diagnosis of tuberculosis of the lungs is three times test of the phlegm .
The bacteria of the tuberculosis comes out of the patient in the form of droplets on coughing or sneezing .
The bacteria out in the air enters into healthy humans through breath and infects the healthy person with tuberculosis .
Diagnosis is done by testing the bacteria of tuberculosis in the phlegm , X-ray is also used if necessary .
List of training test centres where cancer can be tested .
Tuberculosis can be completely cured .
If the patient does the treatment regularly .
There is treatment for tuberculosis but on recovering a little the patient quits treatment .
Treatment in tuberculosis is now done through the DOTS strategy .
In DOTS strategy patient is administered medicines under the direct care of the health workers .
Which is called DOTS -LRB- Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy -RRB- .
As is revealed from the name - Directly Observed Treatment with Short course chemotherapy means that patient takes short courses of anti-tuberculosis drugs in presence of health worker .
There are two stages in the treatment of tuberculosis .
Intensive phase which goes on for 2-3 months .
Continuation phase is of 4-5 months which depends on the category of the treatment patient is taking .
Under this program these medicines are taken thrice a week on alternate days for 2-3 months -LRB- intensive phase -RRB- .
After this phlegm is tested which if found negative , the patient is issued anti-tuberculosis drugs once in a week in the calendared multi-blistered combo pack .
Remember , the first dose of the weekly pack has to be taken before the health worker .
During the continuation phase after two months phlegm should be tested and also after the treatment is complete .
You will watch the patient during the period of continuation phase .
The best way to check the disease is that if all the phlegm patients are made negative then the patient can not infect and whoever human is having coughs of more than three weeks then he should be encouraged to take DOTS after the three phlegm test .
Yellow fever is mosquito communicated disease .
Yellow fever is supposed to be the cause of several epidemics .
Yellow fever occurs due to an arbovirus of the family of flaviviridae .
Arbovirus is a gram positive single-formula RNA virus .
Like malaria this virus also enters into humans through mosquito saliva .
The mosquitoes that spread yellow fever aedes simpsaloni , aedes africanus and aedes aegypti .
Children can be saved from tuberculosis by administering BCG vaccine .
Vaccine must be administered after birth as early as possible .
Refer the patient for treatment to the near primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center .
Send the persons having cough with phlegm or without phlegm or phlegm with blood for three weeks or more to the primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center for tests .
Keep enquiring about the tuberculosis patients whether they went to the primary health center or district tuberculosis disease center for advice or not .
You must get all the babies of the area vaccinated for BCG with the help of the health workers -LRB- women -RRB- .
Educate people all about the prevention of tuberculosis and controlling it .
Two medicine stores - Dehradun and Udham Singh Nagar - have been built in the state to distribute medicines .
So that the medicines could be made available to far-off districts in time .
Supply of medicines is done by the Government of India .
To run Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme properly a four-wheeler vehicle has been made available by the Government of India in 8 districts -LRB- Tehri , Paudi , Uttarkashi , Chamoli , Nainital , Pithauragarh , Almora and Dehradun -RRB- .
Each treatment centres has been provided with a two-wheeler by the Government of India .
Each Microscopic Centre has been provided with one binocular microscope .
5 districts -LRB- Haridwar , Udham Singh Nagar , Rudraprayag , Bageshwar and Champawat -RRB- have been provided with four wheeler vehicle by the State Government .
Tetanus is a type of infection which occurs due to such bacteria that are found in dust , dirt and rusted metals .
The bacteria of tetanus enters inside through normal cuts occurring to the body .
Muscles convulse because of the bacteria .
If the bacteria attack the muscles of the jaws then jaws convulse and the mouth neither opens nor it closes .
Generally it is very fast but some of its slow cases shows up when a person is already infected with a flavivirus .
After the infection the virus at first increases its number by reproducing locally , after that it spreads throughout the body through lymph carrying arteries .
The muscle of the breathing pipe also convulse due to tetanus .
This is a kind of bacteria that closes the lungs with phlegm -LRB- a kind of sticky , wet material -RRB- due to which such an acute sound comes out on coughing as if a dog is barking .
The start of yellow fever starts suddenly 3 to 5 days after the infection .
Because of bacteria such organisms may also emerge that causes pneumonia and bronchitis -LRB- infection of the lungs -RRB- .
Typhoid fever is such a disease that starts as an infection in the gastrointestinal passage and takes the form of a full-fledged disease .
The cause of typhoid is a type of insect that is called salmonella typhi .
Each patient has different symptoms of it but some symptoms are included in common symptoms - periodic fever , headache , tiredness and weakness , change in behavior and stomach problems in the initial stage of the disease and constipation followed by loose motion .
When any food item or beverage with salmonella typhi is taken then generally most of organic constituents become inactive by the presence of the acid present in the abdomen .
If these insects reach the abdomen in great numbers then some of these insects reach the small intestine .
Vaccine is the most effective and reliable solution for safety for typhoid fever .
Typhoid vaccination is recommended by different international and national health officers for persons traveling the regional areas .
This vaccination is also recommended for school children and youth and adults as well in the areas where typhoid fever is present as a major public health problem in the persons of that age group .
Salmonella typhi with antibiotic resistance is found in typhoid fever .
This is how you should take care of your teeth .
High fever , cold , bleeding from skin , high heart pulse , headache , waist pain and diabetes occur in serious cases of yellow fever .
The death rate goes up to 85 % on the spread of yellow fever as an epidemic .
Yellow fever disease spreads in different ways in the rural and jungle areas and in the urban areas .
The effect is very high in the cities due to more density of population and more carrier mosquito population .
There is no real treatment for yellow fever .
Most of the virus generated diseases do not have a cure , only corollary treatment and treatment on the basis of symptoms are done .
The patient of fever should be given a lot of rest , fresh air and plenty of liquid to drink .
In the hamster model of the yellow fever using ribavirin early is considered to an effective treatment .
Ribavirin is effective in yellow fever in the same as it proves effective in hepatitis-C .
Historical report says that the death rate in this disease has been from 5 . % to 33 % .
CDC has said that the death rate is considered to be 15 .
While the WHO has said in a fact sheet issued in 2001 that 15 % patients enter a toxic stage in which half of them die and half are saved .
Yellow fever has an very important place in the history of Afric , America , Europe and the Caribbean Islands .
Yellow fever spread the worst in 1978 in the United States due which 20 thousand had died in Mississippi valley itself .
Naturopathy is a medical-philosophy .
The basis of treatment of diseases and health recuperation under naturopathy is - the natural strength of the body to fight disease molecules .
There are several methods under naturopathy . such as - water therapy , homeopathy , sun therapy , acupuncture , acupressure , soil therapy etc .
The contribution of several medical therapies are there in the propagation of naturopathy . such as the Ayurveda of India and the Nature Cure of Europe .
Naturopathy is a creative method of treatment , the goal of which is to end the root cause of disease with the use of available elements .
This is not just a treatment method but a life style according to the internal important powers or natural elements present in the human body .
In this natural treatment method natural food , specially fresh fruits and raw or lightly cooked vegetables play conclusive role in the treatment of different diseases .
Naturopathy is a total revolution in life style and science .
Naturopathy is a special boon for the poor persons and the poor nations .
Abnormal state of any part of skin is called skin disease .
Skin is the biggest system of the body .
This occurs due to direct contact with external environment .
Besides this the diseases of several other systems of parts -LRB- such as piles -RRB- are expressed through the skin itself .
Chikungunya is a long extending disease of the joints .
A great pain occurs in the joints in Chikungunya .
The aggressive stage of Chikungunya goes on for 2 to 5 days only but the pain of joints continue for months or weeks .
Chikununya virus is an arbovirus that is considered to be of the family of alphavirus .
Chikungunia enters into human through the bite of aedes mosquito .
It takes 2 to 4 days for Chikungunia to spread after entering into body .
The patients of Chikungunia can have acute joint pain for a long time that depends on their age .
Chikungunia disease spreads in the cycle of human-mosquito-human .
The virus of chikungunia is found mainly in monkeys but other species including humans can also be affected from it .
The most effective way of safety from the disease of chikungunia is to escape coming in contact with disease carrying mosquitoes .
There is no treatment for chikungunia nor is there any vaccine available against it .
Chloroquine is proving effective against the symptoms of chikungunia .
Kidney stones is a disease of the urinary system in which small stone like hard things form inside the kidney .
Generally these stones are flushed out from the body through the urinary passage .
But if they grow enough -LRB- 2-3 mm in size -RRB- then these can create blockage in the urinary tract .
Stone is found normally in the people of the age of 30 to 60 years .
Stone is found four times more among men than in women .
Stone of bladder forms more in children and old people while in adults stone form mostly in kidney and urinary tract .
The most regrettable thing is that only a few percent patients of stone get it treated .
The patients having diabetes have a good chance of catching the disease of kidney .
If a patient has the disease of blood pressure then he should pay attention on controlling blood pressure with regular medicine .
Because if blood pressure increases kidneys may also malfunction .
State of pain in case of stone in kidney .
In stone a sudden pain occurs in the lower part of the back or abdomen which goes up to the joint of the abdomen and thighs .
The pain of stone stays for some minutes or hours and relief comes intermittently .
There can also be complaint of nausea along with pain and vomiting .
If there is an infection in a part related to urinary system then fever , shivering , perspiration , pain along with urine etc . may also be included in the symptoms .
Blood also may come in urine .
Most of the patients of stone in kidney complain of acute pain starting from towards the abdomen .
This pain arises intermittently and stays for from a few minutes till several hours , this is called renal chronine .
The chief symptom of stone disease is that in it the pain starts from the lower part of the back and goes towards thighs .
Stone of the kidneys are diagnosed by complete medical test , X-ray-sonography , dye injection or ultrasound tests .
Some solutions of safety from stone .
Drink plenty of water so that 2 to 2 . litre of urine forms everyday .
There should be less amount of protein , nitrogen and sodium in diet .
Do not take such materials which has more amount of oxalate . such as chocolate , soyabean , almond , spinach etc .
Avoid Coca-Cola and other such beverages .
Heavy amount of vitamin-C should not be taken .
The danger of stone is less with the juice of orange etc .
Different kinds of stones , some out of which are made of calcium and some of uric acid .
The meaning of organ transplant is to transplant a healthy and functional organ from a body in the place of a damaged or unsuccessful part of another body .
Transplanting an organ of a patient into another organ of the same patient also comes under the category of organ transplant .
Organ donator can be both alive or dead .
Among the transplantable organs are included heart , kidney , liver , lungs , pancreas , penis , eyes and intestine .
Transplantation medicine is one of the most challenging and complex areas of modern medical discipline .
Unacceptance of transplanted organ by the body is among some of the biggest problems of the medical management area .
Where the immune system of the body rejects the transplanted organ by reacting against it and because of this transplant becomes unsuccessful and now a big challenge for the transplant medicine is to keep the transplanted organ active in the same body .
Transplantation is a very time sensitive process .
Bones , tendons , cornea , heart valves , veins , arm and skin are included among the tissues that can be transplanted .
There is a lack of suitable organs for transplant in most of the countries .
There is a formal system to alleviate risks of unacceptance and to manage allocation in most of the countries .
Some countries are attached to international organizations such as Eurotransplant so that the supply of organs can be assured .
Transplantation also brings some life ethical issues to the fore such as definition of death , when and how an agreement is to be given for an organ and payment for the used organ in transplant .
Amoeba dysentry disease emerges from a special kind of microbic bacteria called Entamoeba histolytica .
Entamoeba is present in the large intestine of the body in two forms .
These forms are called cyst and ova .
Humans takes it inside the body in the form of cyst through food items and beverages .
This cyst sometimes takes the form of eggs on entering the large intestine .
Among the main symptoms of dysentery patient has diarrhoea along with an acute form of stomach ache and an acute convulsion occurs near the anus .
On diagnosing such patients a tenderness is found in caecum and the left iliac region and some fever also occurs .
Flies are extremely helpful in spreading dysentery .
Toilet occurs 12 to 24 times or more a day and most of the part of the excreta is mucus and thickened blood .
Sometimes this amoeba enters the portal vein and creates epatitis and abscess blisters .
Abscess is a serious type of fatal disease .
When the abscess blasts then as a result its pus creates several fatal diseases on entering lungs , stomach , large intestine , peritoneum and pericardium .
Among the main symptoms of abscess there is an acute pain in the liver part of the patient which sometimes spreads to the right shoulder .
Besides this headache , shivering and fever also reach their pinnacle .
Patient feels acute pain and burn on just touching the liver part and the skin above it becomes sensitive .
To avoid abscess all the food items and beverages should be kept away from flies .
The person from whose excreta the cyst comes out should not do any work of the kitchen until blood and phlegm has stopped coming through excreta .
The patient of dysentery should eat barley .
If the power of eyes is more then one should wear contact lens .
Contact lens should be of high quality .
Washing eyes regularly is a good habit .
When the mucus has stopped coming out then the patient of dysentery can be given thin tapioca pearls -LRB- sabudana -RRB- arrowroot , rice , curd etc .
For good health of the eyes one should have vitamin-A rich diet .
The health of eyes remain good with regular yoga as well .
Your eyes are priceless , protect it .
Complete it .
The most common tumors found in women are swelling of the uterus glands , fibroid or leiomyoma .
This knot is found in approximately 30 to 40 % women .
This fact has come forward from regular sonography .
In many cases this does not produce any symptoms but in many cases this becomes reason for pain , bleeding and infertility .
Predominantly this is seen in women of 30 - 40 years of age .
Young girls also get infested with this at times .
The size of the swelling decreases after menopause .
But after taking hormone therapy the size may increase again .
This disease is found more in women of dark complexion in comparison to women of fair complexion .
The possibility of the occurrence of this increases if there are no or few children .
This disease is seen less also in women who use pills for family planning .
The danger of fibroid increases in menarche at young age .
If mother , sister etc . in the family have fibroid tumor then the possibility of the occurrence of this increases .
The danger also increases with the consumption of alcohol , cigarette and meat .
Vegetarianism helps in being saved from fibroid .
This is the tumor of muscles and fibrous tissues .
Approximately 20 - 30 % fibroids are symptom less .
Unusual , excessive bleeding , pain during menses .
Pain in abdomen , pain of waist .
Infertility due to knot inside uterus .
Symptoms due to pressure - difficulty in micturition .
Need of delivery with operation .
Anemia due to excessive bleeding post - delivery .
Difficulties occur many times in the cure of fibroid .
The uterus also increases in ovarian tumor - endometriosis , pregnancy adenomyosis etc .
Important tests .
Sonography , through abdomen and vagina .
The presence of swelling glands only is not a prerequisite for its removal .
If the submucos fibroid is small then it can be removed through hysteroscopic uterine endoscopy .
The submucos fibroid can also be removed with laser .
Before the removal of intramural fibroid it is seen what is the age of the woman , whether there are children or not , whether the family is complete or not , what does the female want .
Myomectomy operation can be carried out through hysteroscopy or laparoscopy or laprotomy -LRB- opening the abdomen -RRB- .
Only the tumor is taken out in case of young women who do not want more children .
If the age is not less , the tumor is quite big and there is no need for children then the whole uterus is removed together with the knot , hysterectomy .
By putting a pipe through the thigh artery in laparoscopic myolysis , the uterine artery is blocked by putting poly vinyl and gel foam particles .
The supply of blood reaching the swelling glands gets stopped through this and the swelling glands reduce up to 60 % .
Breast cancer is a dreadful name for women .
Thousands of deaths occur due to cancer being not recognized in initial days .
In cancer maximum people break down mentally and financially .
If breast cancer is recognized in the initial condition itself then its treatment is possible without any physical deformity .
At the same time cent percent patients can be ridden from the disease also .
Thus lacs of women and families can be saved from mental and financial agony .
In present times due to changes in social and living habits etc cancer is spreading very fast .
Till date many methods of cancer test like mammography , MRI , CT scan etc are helpful though but somehow or the other the side effects of radiation is seen in these .
In this condition the doctors have got hold of a new weapon - infrared thermography .
In infrared thermography , breast cancer due to ill effects of lethal radiation can be tested as fast as possible .
Greek and Egyptian doctors were aware of the disease of breast cancer and temperature of the body .
Sir William Harchell discovered infrared and thermal radiations in 1800 AD .
But till 1970 it was not certain that infrared could be used in the field of medicine .
Breast thermography helps in the detection of cancer in its very initial days .
Lacs of women can be benefitted from breast thermography .
The use of infrared thermography can be done in the detection of arteries being narrow as well etc . in diabetes .
If there is swelling in brain , brain tumor or meningitis in brain then the pressure of intracranial veins increases .
If there is rheumatoid arthritis or spondilitis then swelling occurs in eyes .
The effect of blood pressure on eyes is huge .
Due to blood pressure the veins of the eyes may be blocked or else bleeding can occur .
Due to this the eye sight may go even .
All the diseases of kidney and head can be diagnosed through eyes easily .
Anything altered on eyes has direct impact on kidney .
How much diabetes damages our body , even this can be diagnosed through eyes alone .
By taking the medicine chloroquine , the eye sight can completely go .
Eye sight can weaken due to Viagra .
If someone has diabetes then he must go to the doctor even if there is no eye problem .
The eyes of children after four years must be tested .
If there is any problem in his eyes then that can be corrected with this .
In small kids if there is any complaint of eye squint then many times it can be corrected even without surgery .
With age the eyes should certainly be tested at least once in a year .
If having vision syndrome then the person must get the check up done continuously .
Do not put any medicine in the eyes without consulting the doctor .
If anyone 's paternal uncle , maternal uncle , father or mother have cataract then the check up must be done regularly .
Due to cataract the pressure of the eyes can increase because of which the veins can be spoiled .
Many times cataract comes fast in the eyes .
Never look towards sun with naked eyes .
There is always a need to protect eyes from the ultraviolet rays of the sun .
The eye sight does not increase by walking on green grass .

In people of 50 years and above this disease also happens in serious and more painful condition .
As the age increases , the cases of arthritis also increase .
3 persons out of every 5 below 65 years of age have been seen to be patients of arthritis .
If the cure and treatment of arthritis is not done on time then it causes great damage to the joints and bones of the body .
Although arthritis is a disease affecting women world wide .
In our country this disease affects women even more because of special actions like sitting down for toilet or sitting down on floor for domestic work .
The knee joint is actually the joint between the thigh bone -LRB- femur -RRB- and the bone of foot -LRB- tibia -RRB- .
The cartilage once destroyed may not be corrected again by any medicine .
Because of the reason of damage happening in cartilage the patient suffering from arthritis also faces problem in activities like walking , climbing up the stairs and sitting down or taking bath while sitting down .

Fast treatment means less damage to the joints and because of this the patient has to suffer less pain .
Generally the advice of surgery is also given on arthritis becoming serious .
In patients where arthritis has reached the preliminary stage , for patients in whom alternatives like unicompartmental knee resurfacing and hip resurfacing are very beneficial .
Total hip knee replacement -LRB- TKR -RRB- is useful in case of arthritis affecting the entire joint .

The newest alternative in knee implant is rotating platform high flexion knee , due to which in all activities like walking , bending during gardening , sitting for driving or exercising , climbing down the stairs the patient gets comfort .

Days back a surprising report taking up mental problems was published in a national level newspaper .
According to the report , approximately one fourth of the population of the country suffers from some or the other type of mental problems in their lifetime .
This matter can not be completely true but to consider it a guess will also not be correct .
In order to search luxury and comfort man may be making progress by leaps and bounds but his brain has to bear a lot of harms for this .
Old and aged , children , everyone is suffering from various types of mental tension and are coming in the captivities of psychological disorders .
Even though not all might be taking the advice of psychiatrists or psychologists .
But the number of patients coming to the psychiatrist and psychologists today has increased much than earlier .
The advice of the psychologists is proving ineffective and modern medicines which suppress the symptoms of the problem are delivering more harm .
In the pomp of multimillion advertisements of modern medical science perhaps very few people will accept the truth that methods of effective treatment of common mental problems and severe psychological disorders are present in the ancient Indian medical science , that is , Ayurveda .
The cure , analysis and treatment of psychological disorders are discussed in detail in Ayurvedic texts .
Maharishi Charak tells about three types of diseases in sutrasthan of ' Charak Samhita ' . . nij 2 . aagantu 3 . maanas .
The Nij disorders are those which occur due to the imbalance of tridisorders -LRB- gas , bile , cough -RRB- .
Aagantu diseases are those which occur due to ghosts -LRB- microbes -RRB- , polluted air and maanas diseases are those psychological disorders which occur due to desires and jealousy .
As all of you know , Ayurveda is not just the method of treatment , it is also a science of life .
In Ayurveda not just the symptoms of disease are treated but by treating the root cause of disease body is holistically made healthy .
The meaning of complete health is the health of brain and soul together with the body .
If the health of any one of the brain or the soul is not good then it is definite for the health of the other to get affected .
Healthy mind can not reside in unhealthy body .
There are three properties of man - saatvik , rajasik and tamasik , these properties are decided on the basis of balance of tridosh and the entire mental health depends on it .
The nature of man , his judgement and decisive ability , the multiplicity of his character till the extent of the entire personality depends on these three properties of saatvik , rajsik and tamsik properties .
If there is increase in the rajsik and tamsik properties in man due to his food and life style then he can be surrounded with psychological disorders .
According to few specialists , the entire working system of brain depends on the three properties of desire , pride and intelligence .
Desire has control on brain and desire works according to the dictates of pride .
Intelligence which helps the brain to decide is the most important of all .
With the increase of the effect of desire or pride on intelligence , the mental balance disrupts , mental frenzy and tension get incentive and as a result psychological disorders occur .
According to ` Charak samhita ' , in the case of mental disorders , negative effects affect the eight basic psychological causes of will - will , intelligence , memory , feeling , devotion , morality , efforts and behavior .
Due to this reason man does not stay fit for social life .
With the decrease of brilliance in body especially in tissues of brain , the capacity of brain to fight with tension is affected because of which the person gradually becomes prey to the psychological disorders .
This is the reason why together with consumption of nutritive food , excellent digestive capacity is given boundless importance in Ayurveda .
Renowned Yoga and spiritual Deepak Chopra considers ' radiation and life ' also important together with brilliance for mental health .
According to Dr . Chopra , life is that minute energy which is essential in the proper functioning of brain and body .
Radiation is that inner physical strength which by increasing our comprehension power helps us in taking the right decision .
Due to their imbalance also there is maximum danger of becoming the victim of psychological disorders .
One main cause for occurrence of mental disorders for any person is also not being able to strike a proper balance with his surroundings .
In general the main mental disorders that are seen due to this imbalance include hyper sexuality , anger , greed , delusion , jealousy , frenzy , sadness , worry , rage , fear , happiness etc .
If the above mentioned mental condition persists then it gives birth to serious mental diseases like psychosis , epilepsy , hysteria , obsession , illusion , delusion , unconsciousness , excessive alcoholism , etc .
The way in which psychologists and doctors are in dark to a great extent regarding the built and functions of brain similarly all the factors which lead to psychological disorders are not known till now .
Dr . Deepak Chopra says . the greatest effect of our mental health is seen on our body ' .
In the same way the good and bad effects of physical health can be seen on the brain .
In order to escape from such diseases it is important that we learn to strike balance between our body and mind - brain .
Days back one of my highly educated acquaintances came to me for advice .
After knowing the disease symptoms and on the basis of his sonography reports , his family doctor told him that he has hernia and the only treatment for that is surgery .
He had also heard something about hernia .
According to him , this is not a serious problem and just to increase the bill doctors advice for surgery and after surgery also there is a danger for it to appear again , etc .
Seeing the commercialisation in the medical field it was natural for such suspicions to occur .
The information that his physician gave him regarding hernia , it is correct .
Surgery is its only cure and the more the delay the more increased would be the discomfort .
After my advice saying of meeting soon and taking of quick decision in this context he went away .
He got the surgery done afterwards according to his physician ' s consultation or stayed in the maze of third or fourth opinion . do not have any information of this .
It is mentionable that ten percent of the total population of our country certainly falls prey to hernia in its lifespan .
Like the disease hernia construction of a saclike creation takes place from the swelling of tissues in any particular organ of the patient due to genetic or any other reason .
Although hernia can affect just any part of the body but the maximum cases are connected to belly or stomach .
That is , in all cases of hernia approximately 75 % cases are related to stomach .
But in the essay we will discuss in the context of hernia of stomach .
There are three main kinds of this type of hernia too - inguinal hernia affecting the groin region , umbilical hernia affecting the navel region and incisional area rising at the place of surgery of stomach .
Inguinal Hernia : This is a swelling connected to the inguinal canal on the inner walls of stomach and therefore it has been given the name of inguinal hernia .
The case of this is maximum in approximately all cases of hernia .
It is believed that at some time or the other approximately 5 % part of the total population certainly becomes prey to this malfunction .
The surgery done for treatment of inguinal hernia is most common .
Umbilical hernia is related to stomach .
Of all the cases of hernia related to stomach , approximately 10 to 30 % cases are those of umbilical hernia .
Umbilical hernia is generally due to congenital disorders .
In fact one hole of the stomach wall which is connected to the umbilical nerve often gets closed before birth .
In some cases this does not happen because of which hernia erupts near navel center .
If the size of this type of hernia is small , that is , less than half inch then it generally gets closed on its own by the time the child reaches the age of two years .
Large sized hernia which does not stop on their own , surgery is important for their treatment .
This surgery is done between two to four years of age of the child .
In some cases it has been seen that the hole of stomach closes with birth .
But in comparison to other parts of wall of stomach that part is very weak .
Result , the chance of growth of hernia at that place becomes very high .
Incisional hernia . large population has to cross small surgical process of the stomach .
Due to the reason of this surgery for the cracks to appear in the walls of stomach is also common .
Gradually the part of stomach having cracks keeps becoming weak and danger for hernia to grow there becomes very high .
2 to 10 percent cases of a few cases of hernia of stomach are of this type .
Due to the reason of the permanent weakening of walls of stomach there is a chance for hernia to occur once more for second time through surgery .
One of the main causes of hernia to occur is the weakening of walls of stomach .
This problem can occur due to any one or many of the reasons like congenital reasons , due to increasing age , as a result of surgery , strain in muscles during pregnancy , reducing weight fast for decreasing obesity , diseases like marfan syndrome etc .
Excessive pressure inside the stomach is also built due to growth of hydrosil , growth of tumor in uterus , due to pregnancy , etc . because of which the walls of stomach become weak and the danger of hernia increases .
It is very easy to know the symptoms of hernia .
During the examination of the swelled surface in the affected areas one gets to see swelling or rise .
In affected areas the complaint of pain can also occur .
Swelling increases on putting more pressure while lifting weight , micturition or defecation .
Swelling becomes clearly visible in some cases by staying standing for long or coughing as well .
The pain occurring due to the reason of hernia is very intense .
The intensity of pain increases immensely after physical labor or as the day ends .
It is not difficult to recognize the symptoms of hernia .
Generally doctors make an estimate if there is hernia or not through the symptoms told by the patient , his family history and the examination of regions like groin , navel etc .
Apart from it generally there is no need of any other test for the cure of this disease to experienced and specialist doctor .
Where making estimation of the disease is difficult there advice is given to get ultrasound or CAT scan done .
The aforesaid tests are often important for testing the chances of hydrosil .
The only possible treatment of hernia is surgery itself .
Riddance from this problem can be obtained only through surgery .
Famous by the name of hernioplasty this surgery is also done with the help of laparoscopy , endoscopy etc .
In some cases open surgery is also done .
For the treatment of hernia the method of surgery which is brought into maximum use these days , that surgery is laparoscopy .
Due to being minimal invasive surgery , the surgery is done by putting an incision of only 2 . mm to the patient .
As a result the patient starts walking after few hours of surgery .
He gets working in normal way after just two - three days of surgery and within 5 to 7 days he gets to his daily works .
Under this technique of surgery . laparoscope fixed with microscopic camera is made to enter the region of hernia through a small tube .
Surgeon gets helped by means of camera in seeing hernia and the adjoining regions on the video screen .
By means of another tube entered inside the stomach the surgeon rectifies hernia .
The rectification of hernia is done through the posterior part of walls of stomach .
A netted mesh is sewn on the destroyed area of hernia and this way riddance is got from the problem .
With the help of laparoscopy hernia is almost a completely safe process .
Yes , in approximately ten percent cases small complications after surgery are certainly got to be seen .
Generally during hernioplasty there is a danger of infection in the region of surgery , destruction in the adjoining blood vessels and nerves and harm to the nearby organs , etc .
Where the presence of experienced doctor reduces its danger to minimum there a well equipped hospital is capable of controlling them in a better way in case of complication .
As I told you earlier , the only possible treatment of hernia is surgery and because of techniques of minimum incision it is also very safe .
But from fear of surgery or considering hernia as a less serious disease can put the patient ' s life at risk .
It is worth mentioning that hernia is such a problem which does not get cured on its own and it keeps on increasing with time .
If it is left to increase this way then its rectification through surgery becomes comparatively more difficult .
In the situation of no treatment supply of blood gets affected due to blood vessels being pressed or due to obstruction especially in veins because of which there is danger of ischamial nephrosis and gangrene .
Because of hernia due to obstruction in intestines the flow of matter present in them stops .
Consequently tightness , vomiting , release of gas , actions like discharge of faeces may get affected and immediate surgery becomes essential .
In some cases the work efficiency of the organ affected with hernia or its nearby organs get affected and other physical complications start increasing .
With no treatment the danger of hydrosil to happen from hernia can also be there .
Therefore do not delay in hernia .
With delay not just the danger of life risk would increase but comparatively there would also be problems in surgery .

Diabetes is not a disease which happens only to aged and obese people .
The treatment of diabetes mellitus -LRB- sugar found in urine -RRB- occurring in children is far more difficult because the treatment of children is done especially by keeping in mind their physical and emotional condition .
In diabetes the quantity of sugar in blood increases immensely because the body fails to produce the insulin being secreted from pancreas .
Diabetes is of two types .
At some point of time type 1 diabetes was called ' juvenile onset diabetes ' .
This is that condition of patient when the insulin is secreted less or not secreted at all . because the immune system attacks the cells of pancreas .
This disease may occur with great speed in the age of 6 to 13 years .
In type 2 diabetes the body does not stay sensitive to the insulin produced inside it .
This disease occurs in extremely obese teenagers who have this disease in their family .
Type 2 diabetes grows gradually .

The cure of the disease is ascertained by the test of urine and fasting blood sugar -LRB- more than 126 mg -RRB- .
For the parents who have children with diabetes keeping their children away from sweets and apart from taking samples to monitor blood sugar seeing them getting injected to take insulin may seem to be very painful but this may have to be done several times in a day .
In such situation they can get great relief from counselling .
You should consider diabetes as an obstinate problem and not a disease whose cure will surely be found some time or the other .
In order to keep the balance of blood sugar level OK the insulin has to be balanced and for this make the children exercise daily .
Together with this give him food of this type which has little carbohydrate , balanced quantity of fat , more fiber and less sodium 6 times a day little by little .
The teachers , family members and kin members should also be aware of his disease .
The young people can fight the disease by taking medicines as advised by the doctor and bringing change in the lifestyle .
For this they should reform the eating pattern , reduce weight and do exercise .
Keep in mind that you have to make your diabetic child as self - dependent as possible so that for him taking injection becomes as easy as brushing teeth .
He can learn to do all these on his own by the time he is of 10 years of age .
When does eye problem occur .
If your child has a problem in doing school work .
If he feels pain in eyes , throbbing pain or tiredness .
He does not see the writing on the black board clearly .
If he brings his book very close to eyes while reading the book .
Then take him to an eye specialist immediately .
Often the teachers of children detect such problems on seeing and make you cautious .
Important information connected to antibiotic .
If your doctor asks you to keep an eye on the symptoms of the disease for 48 hours then follow his advice .
If you are said that the child has to take antibiotics for 5 days and in three days only all the symptoms of disease vanish then also do not stop taking medicine before the completion of 5 days .
This way by stopping the medicine in between the immune capacity of bacteria increases , consequently that problem can again start to grow .

Maize or corn is helpful in getting rid of stomach ulcer .
Because of being a food of high fibers it is extremely useful in reducing weight .
Maize provides better energy in weakness .
On taking in the form of corn flake it is helpful in the stopping of heart disease .
Maize is one of the most popular food items in the world .
Full of protein and vitamins where corn provides energy to the body , there it is also very easily digestible .
After wheat the production of corn is maximum in India .
America is the largest exporter of this .

By eating apple the secretion of the saliva of mouth is good .
Eating apple is good for the health of your teeth .
Our brain of around 1 . to 1 . kilogram weight seems to be made of soft matter of brown color .
Our brain is in fact a complex mass of thousand crore of nerve cells only .
The brain of small honeybee is also made up of these cells only .
One unit of brain , neuron or nerve cell is complete and independent in itself .
Every nerve cell has a long tail .
This tail is as small as 1 mm in some , then in others it is as long as thousand mm or one metre .
The brain is an infinite maze of several thousand crores of cells and the mutual network between them .
On the whole either the pregnancy does not stay in women suffering from tumor or even if it stays then many more complications occur during pregnancy .
Like abortion , premature delivery , premature rupture of the amniotic fluid sac , dislocation of placenta -LRB- premature -RRB- , weakening of the foetus in the womb , the foetus getting crossed , inverted or skewed .
The child getting stuck at the time of delivery .
The need of caesarean operation for the delivery .
Complications while the operation , need to remove the uterus .
Excessive bleeding post delivery .
Getting anaemic owing to excessive bleeding .
Increase in the size of fibroid .
Many times the cure of uterine glandular swelling is problematic .
The size of uterus also increases in ovarine knot-endometriosis , pregnancy edinomyosis etc . but a skilful gynaecologist can easily find out the disease after a careful examination .
The following tests are important for fibroid .
Sonography through abdomen or vagina -LRB- transabdominal and transvaginal -RRB- .
Laparoscopy , hysteroscopy . . . . -LRB- if needed -RRB- .
H . . . -LRB- if the doctor thinks essential -RRB- .
After finding out the condition of fibroid in the uterus with these tests , it can be ascertained by which method it can be removed .
Mere presence of the glandular swelling is not a prerequisite for its removal .
If the symptoms are not appearing then the woman can be counselled and can be asked to come for check up after some time , this treatment in itself is satisfactory .
There is a knot , and therefore it has to be removed , it is not necessary .
If the knot is very big and is getting bigger continuously , if the woman is panicking , the symptoms increase , the symptoms of bleeding , pain and pressure appear , then only it should be removed .
If the sub mucous fibroid is small then it can be removed with the help of uterine hysteroscopic endoscopy .
The fibroid can also be removed with the help of lasers .
There are two types of operations for fibroid .
Myomactomy -LRB- removal of knot only -RRB- , this operation is done with hysteroscopy or laparoscopy by doing laparotomy -LRB- opening stomach -RRB- .
Just the tumor is removed in case of young aged females who do not want more children .
Hysterectomy : If the age is not less , the tumor is very big and there is no need of having more children then the entire uterus is removed together with the tumor .
Medication is provided to decrease bleeding and for pain relief and iron is given for treating anemia .
Some special injection and medicine can be given to reduce the size of the fibroid .
GnRH analog -LRB- decapeptyl or lupride -RRB- , mifepristone , danazol are the main medicines .
But due to these medicines the symptoms of bone weakness and menopause are produced .
The condition becomes as before on stopping the medicine .
The modern treatment laparoscopic myolysis -LRB- through laser Nd-YYAG -RRB- .
The blocking of uterine artery -LRB- ambolization -RRB- .
In modern treatment the uterine artery is blocked by putting poly vinyl particles or gel foam powder through a pipe entered through the thigh artery after anaesthesising it .
By blocking the uterine artery the blood supply available to the tumor gets obstructed and the tumor reduces up to 60 % .
A skilful gynaecologist is capable of doing proper treatment after considering everything .
Therefore , it is unnecessary to be scared of leiomyoma disease .
The investigation of the secrets of brain .
If we gradually cut open with a saw and separate the upper part of the skull of a man after making him unconscious on an operation table then by peering inside we can ourselves see the live brain with our own eyes .
Similarly , neuro-surgeons operate the brain by cutting the skull bones with saw and drill .
Bacterial dysentery occurs from a special type of bacteria -LRB- bacilli -RRB- .
Many things are of just the sort as the inner kernel of the walnut seen after cracking it .
Through the creative capacity or the assistance of the brain itself Einstein . . . Raman , Tagore and Shakespeare could produce their extreme original and unique ideas .
By look so simple but how wonderful is the brain in work capacity .
On investigating any part of brain with microscope we will see that it is mainly made of just one type of cell , neuron or nerve cell .
In bacterial dysentery there is repeated discharge of fecus consisting of blood and phlegm .
Disease of bacterial dysentery is more rampant in places of temperate environment .
The disease of bacterial dysentery occurs more in monsoon season in India .
In the main part of the brain all the life processes keep taking place and a very small center or nucleus controls all of them in the same way as in any other normal cell .
In women , men and all the aged people the disease of bacterial dysentery occurs in similar manner .
By disrupting the phlegmatic action of the large intestine and the phlegmatic action of the end part of the small intestine the bacteria of the disease of bacterial dysentery produce solvency in them .
The matter which fascinated Kahal the most , that was the mutual network process of the nerve cells .
In this immense crowd of cells one cell actually does not touch any other cell .
The axon of one appears to be going very near to the other cell but there always remains a certain distance between the two .
Kahal studied these network places with great minuteness , which later on were given the name of synapse by Sir Charles Sherrington .
How does the information or signal reach from one cell to the other cell .
There are special chemicals or neurotransmitters which do the work of messenger in this synapse . Henry Dale and Otto Loewi made an important discovery by finding acetylcholine .
Consciously a valley has been left between every two nerve cell so that the electric impulse can not cross by jumping over , it has to take the help of a chemical messenger and then alone the signal can get forwarded .
After all why the interference of these chemical substances in the electrical communication system .
What is the benefit of this : The question is in fact very interesting and important .
If we think deeply then this one fact comes up that in this system the information travels in one direction only , not haphazard .
Every synapse gives unidirectional instruction , because the chemical substance can be secreted from the end of the axon only .
In fact in axon the electricity can be conducted equally from both the directions just like wire .
But the direction gets decided at every synapse , because the chemical messenger which can cross the valley is present at the end of axon and not in the body of the next cell .
Thus the signals can never cross the synaptic valley in the opposite direction .
Without this directional instruction the signals running between the millions of cells from both the directions then will create ultimate chaos .
The second benefit is that because of this chemical process there is a delay of approximately the thousandth part of a second or 1 . milli second .
This way the signals can be sequenced with respect to time .
The more the synapses in a neuronal circuit , the slower would be the communication in them .
Synapse has one more use as well .
Because of one chemical substance coming medially we can easily interfere in the communication system of brain .
These chemical substances are called medicines .
Many medicines given by the doctors today - like anaesthesia to make unconscious , tranquilizers for inducing sleep and peace , and many intoxicating substances affect these synapses only .
Why the action site of these medicines are synapse and not the nerve cell itself , to understand it will not be now difficult .
Therefore the effect of these medicines are more in those regions only where there is dense net of synapses .
The person afflicted with the disease of bacterial diarrhoea suddenly becomes victim of intense stomach pain and dysentery .
Every cell in itself appears to be very simple as a unit , but the complex mass of thousands of crores of cells give birth to unlimited possibilities by connecting mutually .
Perhaps this only is the physical basis of our intelligence , consciousness and memory .
From the point of view of creation we can divide the brain into many parts .
Because of being enclosed in a box of bones at one end of the body it is not easy for the brain to keep a direct contact with all the distant parts of the body .
Therefore the role of our spinal cord connected with brain in the form of an extension branch is very important .
Like a thick white rope from the neck to the lower part of the back , spinal cord is safe in the spinal bones .
At regular interval , through the medium of 31 spinal nerves from both its sides spinal cord has contact with the entire body .
Each moment our spinal cord keeps receiving information from skin and other organs , and each moment that keeps sending proper instruction to our muscles .
The spinal cord finishes many normal work on its own on this basis , it does not disturb the brain for everything .
For example , it maintains a proper tension in our muscles so that we can keep standing erect .
We withdraw hand when all of a sudden a pin pierces finger .
This reflex action occurs at the level of spinal cord .
The simplest and basic example of the work method of nervous system is this reflex action only .
Apart from this the main use of spinal cord is like a highway alone .
The entire caravan of all the signals between brain and different parts of the body crosses through this spinal cord alone .
Thus the consequence of minor injury on spinal cord can be serious .
But now let us reach to the brain moving above the spinal cord .
The brain starts just as we enter the head .
Or let us say that the spinal cord gets converted into brain .
On seeing it appears as if the brain is like a very big walnut resting on a strong stem or branch .
Therefore we can divide the brain into 2 parts .
One is this straight stem or brain stem and the second is the main part or cerebrum resting on it .
In fact brain stem seems to be similar to the spinal cord , and it is also situated in its straight line , but it is divided into three parts if we see attentively .
The lowest most part is medulla oblongata , very small and common in appearance but very special in importance .
The various centres which control our internal life processes are present in this alone .
Like , breathing , beating of heart , controlling of blood pressure , digestion of food etc. .
A sudden jerk or injury on the medulla can therefore lead to death in a moment .
But there is nothing to get scared in this .
Nature has placed this very important control-room in a very safe place at the center of the head .
At times in scooter or road accident the neck gets jerked very severely , and medulla stops doing its work on getting damaged .
The ordinary looking injury becomes the reason of immediate death .
The same happens when the criminals are hanged .
Medulla alone is the originating place of 7 out of 12 cranial nerves as well .
The cranial nerves control the muscles of face , tongue , shoulders etc . bring auditory signals from the ears and controls many other internal organs .
If we cross the medulla oblongata from top then pons and mid-brain come .
Mid-brain and pons mainly work as junction .
In a way here many small branches emanate from the main stream of nerves or highway .
Similarly 3 branches go to the cerebellum -LRB- mini brain -RRB- located at the back of brain-stem .
Like a skilful computer cerebellum does two very important jobs .
First , because of its support only we are able to maintain our balance by standing on just two lags .
We do not fall even when fleeing , running , doing acrobats , bending forward - backward .
Second , this cerebellum only adjusts all our voluntary actions very minutely .
Cerebellum does their fine adjustment with the voluntary actions .
Earlier we mentioned 12 cranial nerves out of which 7 had their origin from medulla .
Similarly 4 more emanate from pons mid-brain .
Their work is to control the muscles responsible for rotating the eyes and to carry sensation from the face .
Now after crossing the brain stem we reach the most huge and main part of the brain - cerebrum or fore-brain .
On crossing this line one gets to feel a very important difference .
From the unconscious state we have come to the conscious state .
From darkness to light .
We have no intuition of whatever is happening in the brain-stem or cerebellum .
As if we are sleeping in a very deep sleep .
But just on reaching the level of cerebrum we become awake .
We start feeling comfort , sadness .
We feel that we are doing all the works willingly and not like a machine .
We start saying I am there . am doing . am liking it .
Does any machine feel like this .
None of the organisms have as developed cerebrum as is ours .
Let us forget for a moment the difference of small and big and place the brains of mouse and brain close by and see .
The brain stem and other parts appears to be similar in both .
And why should not it be After all both have to control respiration , heart , food , blood pressure etc. .
While jumping and running the rat also has to maintain the balance of its body .
But when we look at the cerebrum we can feel that there is a huge difference between mouse and man .
Our cerebrum has become so huge that it has almost covered all other parts of the brain .
Because of this surprising growth of cerebrum the brain of man seems to be the biggest in proportion to body .
Although the brain of whale and elephant are certainly bigger than ours .
The weight of brain of our closest relative , monkeys , is just half a kilogram .
The weight of the brain of whale is 8000th part of the total weight of its body while the weight of our brain is around 50th part of the weight of our body .
If the bodies of whale and man are made equal then the human brain would look bigger even more than 150 times of the brain of whale .
There is one such speciality in cerebrum which has been a riddle for us even now .
This is divided into two parts , which we call the right and the left cerebral hemispheres .
There is a very small bridge connecting the two - corpus callosum .
Strange thing is this , that the right hemisphere is connected to the left half of the body and controls that alone while the left hemisphere is connected to the right half of the body .
All the nerves traveling to and fro have to cross the middle line to go to the other side .
This very system is found in all the organisms .
The effect of an injury in the right half of the head is seen in the left half of the body .
Similarly , on pricking a needle in the left hand its pain can be felt by the right cerebral hemisphere .
Like a modern office in the cerebrum also the division of labor has been done in a very good manner .
The upper thick surface of 3 mm is called cortex and the maximum nerve cells accumulate in this only .
In the rest inner part the net of wire like nerves are spread .
The small masses of some cells only may be seen somewhere in middle .
The most posterior part of this cortex does the work of vision , while a very small part at the center does hearing .
The system of olfaction is at the lower surface .
Though this part in man has become very unimportant in comparison to animals like dogs .
But we should not forget that neither light nor sound or smell can reach in the brain .
Only the electric impulses are reaching there through the nerves .
So who is seeing , hearing everything while sitting in our cerebrum .
Is one more small man is sitting inside the human brain .
This is a complex riddle by which since time immemorial both scientists and philosophers are being perplexed .
Approximately 1 cm wide and 6 cm long strip on the surface of the central part of the cerebrum is called ` motor cortex ' and all the muscles of the other half of the body is being controlled from here alone .
The representation of body here also is inverted only : head down and legs up .
What is the secret behind this chaotic system , even no one knows this nicely .
It can happen that one day you may solve this mystery .
A similar strip near the motor cortex is called ` sensory cortex ' where all the sensations from the other half of the body come .
Touch , heat , pressure , pricking everything is felt here only .
But how this : We feel pain in finger when thorn pricks , but not in head .
But if thought attentively the sensation on being produced in the finger nerve reaches sensory cortex after crossing spinal cord and brain stem at great speed .
Then only we realize pain .
The pain is in finger , this is only a natural illusion so that we immediately protect our own finger .
Roughly we can conclude this , that our nervous system works in the same way as any telephone system .
If the wire gets severed in the middle then the entire communication of that area gets disrupted .
Similarly , the moment a nerve between the brain and any organ gets severed the transfer of signals stops that very moment .
We can not move our hands and feet even if we feel like .
This is called paralysis .
Nothing has happened to the muscles , not even to the motor cortex .
Only the one which establishes the communication between the two has been cut .
Similarly , now even if we prick needle in the finger or burn it we will not feel any pain .
Similarly , we can easily estimate as to what could be the consequence if any part of the nervous system gets injured or any disease occurs .
In today 's mechanical era this is only natural that we compare the various organs of our body with the instruments used in day today life .
We say that heart is like a pump , eyes like a camera , nerves are like electric wires . and brain .
Quickly the answer would be that the brain is a computer .
Today at every place , whether classroom or shop , office or home , the assistance of machines are being taken to do simple calculations .
We have loaded the burden of our brain on these calculators and computers .
Our brain as well as computers also can do the actions like multiplication , division , addition and subtraction .
But are the methods of both same .
In future could such advanced super computers be made which would have intelligence and consciousness like us .
Does the brain and computer have the only difference of small and big , or do they have some principle differences between them which is not possible to obliterate .
Such interesting questions today are of pervasive importance .
In the efforts to solve the questions , on one the hand the development of computers is getting a lot of help as well .
Right there on the other hand we have also started to understand the secrets of brain in a better way .
Due to contact with machines we have also understood this that for understanding the complexities of any big instrument in a better way we should first make its small and simple model .
In schools and colleges also children must be encouraged to make models of aeroplanes , steam engines , radio etc . so that while playing they should get familiar with the basic construction of these .
Why not we study a small model of brain before understanding an incredible computer like the human brain .
We should make a child and computer sit together and ask both of them to do the same work , multiply 9 by 9 , and whatever the answer comes go on multiplying that with 9 again .
The computer will start working according to the instruction and it will continue working till the time we do not switch that off .
But the child will throw away his paper and pencil in a few minutes and will in fact start questioning you , oh , why are you making me do this useless work .
What does this mean . am tired , leave . will not do anymore .
If we still insist him then he will start doing mistakes , while he also very well knows the methods to multiply same as that of computer .
The child soon gets bored with useless work .
There is unlimited variation in his thinking , not definiteness like computer .
He will suddenly find out a new solution to any question which no one had told him before .
Will any computer start thinking about gravitation like Newton when an apple falls on it .
Or on providing with all the information about strange animals will it find out the theory of evolution like Darwin .
One more interesting thing is that the ability to commit mistakes is also in brain alone , not in computer .
Many times we commit such mistakes while speaking .
The professor of Oxford William Spooner is very famous for this .
Thus it is also called spoonerism .
At present some scientists are engrossed seriously in studying about this as well as to how these mistakes occur in brain .
If we see with an all pervasive point of view then many times in laboratory some of our mistakes only have given birth to new inventions .
It is clear that there are some special qualities in man like intelligence , consciousness , prudence etc to which the best of today 's computers have not been able to reach .
In future it will ever be able to reach , there is doubt in it .
But there are also such things in which the computer seems to be more dexterous than our brain , and here lies its actual usefulness .
The computer can do any calculation very fast , while we will take years to do the same work when sitting with paper and pencil .
The computer which plays chess made by Dr Hans Berliner selects the most suitable move from 175000 moves on analyzing them in just 1 second .
Till that time we will not even be able to count up to five .
That is why in controlling fast moving spaceships , rockets and aeroplanes we have to depend on computer .
Similarly many important calculations today are so long and boring that it would be problematic for us to finish them .
Now after entrusting this job to any computer the scientist can pay attention to more comfortable and satisfactory aspects .
In one more context also if we want to transfer in computer then this can be done in few hours only .
The way in which today another cassette can easily be prepared from the recorded music of one cassette .
But if we want to transfer the entire knowledge accumulated in one human brain to another human brain then how much time will be taken .
Is it therefore that we have to spend 20-25 years on education in schools and colleges .
No matter how advanced or clever the computer is , it does only that work whose process we are aware of and which we have made the computer learn .
Whether 2 has to be added to 2 or to solve the complicated integration of the modern physical science , our brains alone will teach the computers the methods to solve them .
Our brain has programmed the computer , but who programs our brain .
Opposite to the normal congenital reflex actions this newly learned anti-reflex actions may only be established at the level of the most developed part of the brain , that is , cerebrum .
Therefore these have the maximum importance in man .
By making the reflex actions present by birth as base we go on adding new links on them one after the other .
Pavlov started thinking if this is also one of the types of what we call education .
Perhaps this only is the base of our exquisite ability to communicate mutually through a systematic language .
First we point to a child a moving elephant on a road and say that see that is elephant .
Then just by seeing the picture of elephant the child soon starts recognizing it .
Finally , only on seeing the word elephant written on paper the image of elephant forms in his brain .
Is it not a matter of surprise because there is absolutely no kind of similarity between the word elephant and that huge , black quadruple having long trunks .
It seems as if language is the highest achievement of the human brain .
Can the present human society be imagined without language .
Is science , history or business possible if we are not able to tell each other our thoughts through language , or not make them permanent by writing .
Scientists at present are trying to make our closest relatives chimpanzees learn the language , but it is clear that compared to us this ability is negligible in them .
In the past few years Roger Sperry has amazed everyone by doing some very important experiments directly on human brain .
While receiving the Nobel Prize in Stockholm on December 8 , 1981 he told in his speech that the beginning of all the studies started with those patients who used to get very intense epileptic strokes and no medicine was benefitting them .
When there was no way out it was finally decided as to why should not the corpus callosum-the bridge connecting both the cerebral hemispheres be cut in the middle , so that at least the unwanted excitement occurring on one side should not spread to the other side .
The daring with which this operation was done much more surprising than that were the results .
Though we certainly get description of two-headed animals and demons in ancient stories but no one knows as to how will a person with two brains or split brain think actually .
In the words of Roger Sperry if a person with split brain attended a party six months after the surgery then no one was able to see any abnormality in him .
Both the hemispheres of cerebrum continued fulfilling their responsibility by controlling the respective halves of the body .
But after an in-depth study this surprising conclusion was clear that there is a huge difference in the capabilities of both the hemispheres .
Everyone at least know this that the ability of both of our hands are not equal .
In maximum people the straight or right hand is much stronger and dexterous .
The same thing has also been seen in all the animals .
It can easily be estimated by this that our left hemisphere is more effective , and like a class monitor it has command over the other hemisphere .
But when Roger Sperry severed the contact between the two hemispheres then how special is the place of each in our mental activities was estimated for the first time .
If we consider the subjects being taught in the school then the division between hemispheres would be like this .
Left hemisphere - language -LRB- speaking , cognizing the meaning of the words written and heard -RRB- , maths , analysis of problems , estimation of time .
Right hemisphere - geometry , painting , instrumental music , organization of facts , estimation of space .
Whatever we study in class generally gets accumulated in the right or left hemisphere according to this area division .
But because of being connected with corpus callosum the knowledge of one is always available for the other when needed .
On the contrary the matter of the patients of Roger Sperry is in fact indeed exquisite .
Whatever one cerebral hemisphere learns the other does not get to know anything about that .
As a simple example if a pin used to be pierced on the little finger of the right hand and afterwards he was asked to now demonstrate with the left hand that in which finger did he feel the pain then he used to be left dumbfounded .
The contact of left hand is with the right hemisphere and it has no knowledge of the piercing of the pin .
With how much vigor and hard work scientists are engrossed in studying our brain and how thrilling are their experiments .
One attraction of science is even this that all of us can participate in its birth .
In any huge class some students would be uncommon .
That is , instead of playing , writing , eating with the right hand like all of us they would be using the left hand .
These left handed players however have a distinct grandeur in cricket .
What is their ratio in your school or classroom .
In what subjects do they get more marks : Or in what do they take more interest : How is their speaking ability .
If we consider the whole school then is there any difference between girls and boys , small kids and adults in this respect .
But firstly in order to measure everything we have to decide some or the other physical scale .
To reach at any authentic scientific conclusion is difficult without this .
Breast cancer is a scary name for women .
Thousands of deaths can occur if breast cancer is not detected in its initial days .
Maximum succumb financially to breast cancer .
The patient gets tortured by the fear of physical deformity and the chances of the disease to appear again even when the life is saved on late detection at the increase in the seriousness of the surgery .
If cancer is detected in the initial condition only then treatment is possible without any physical deformity , even the patient also can be made disease free cent percent .
This way lacs of women and families can be saved from mental and physical torture .
In contemporary phase rapidity has come in the spread of breast cancer due to changes in the social and lifestyle habits .
Many methods of cancer detection like mammography , MRI , CT scan are useful though till now but some or the other way the ill effects of radiations becomes visible .
In such situation the doctors have got hold of a new weapon - infrared thermography .
In infrared thermography breast cancer can be tested as soon as possible without lethal rays .
Greek and Egyptian medicos knew the relationship of this disease and the temperature of the body .
Sir William Herschel had discovered infrared and heat dissemination in 1800 .
But till 1970 it was not certain whether infrared can be used the field of medicine .
On passing the rays through the prism , the area which is below the red color of the light spectrum gets the maximum heat where we do not see any light .
In this method infrared detector on receiving infrared wave energy converts it in electric signals proportionately .
This ratio is in proportion to the temperature of the targeted organ .
Electromagnetic wave energy is converted to electronic video signal through one of its instruments .
Different pictures are obtained in different diseases and healthy condition , which on recognition the disease is diagnosed .
Breast thermography helps in the detection of cancer in the very initial days and helps in quick treatment .
Of course confirmation from other laboratory methods is certainly important .
Because of less information in it , it is easy to read thermography in comparison to mammography .
Lacs of women can be benefitted with breast thermography .
The use of infrared thermography can be done in the detection of the narrowness of the blood vessels in diabetes etc. .
Several times the disease occurring due to physical relations takes a very dangerous form and gives birth to many other lethal diseases .
Any disease which spreads due to physical relations is called STD , that is , sexually transmitted disease .
Neck cancer and many other cancers can occur from STD .
Some infections together with the complications related to womb , disease of liver may even lead to HIV AIDS .
There are approximately 20 types of sexually transmitted infections .
STD spreads through bacteria , parasites and virus .
Out of them some of the STD which spread rapidly are as following .
HPV , that is , human pappiloma virus is a viral disease .
HPV disease engulfs around 80 % of the total people who make physical relations .
The infection of HPV is of more than 100 types and 3 types of infections out of these spread through sex .
HPV infection engulfs men more rapidly in comparison to women .
On being infected cauliflower like warts appear near genitals and neck of the uterus , hips or neck .
For protection from HPV infection do not make relations with an infected partner if possible .
Even if you make relations then also use latex condoms .
Complete riddance from HPV infection can not however be obtained .
But by burning the warts too with the help of medicines one can get relief .
Genital herpes is also a viral infection which occurs in those who make relations with infected partners .
Genital herpes is of two types .
After the genital herpes infection , inflammation or wounds erupt near vagina or phallus , which causes pain .
Genital herpes infection spreads not only on making relations but also by touching .
Apart from this , in women , this infection also gives birth to diseases like vaginal discharge .
In order to get protection against genital herpes infection do not make relations with multiple partners .
Even by using condoms while making relations it can not be stopped therefore do not even make relation during infection .
If pregnant woman is afflicted with this then while delivery she may pass this infection on to her baby .
Syphilis is a bacterial infection .
Syphilis affects lips , mouth , kidneys and genitals .
Apart from an infected partner syphilis can also pass from a pregnant mother to her child .
In the initial symptoms there are small inflammations which do not pain .
At times swelling also occurs near lymph nodes in which there is no itching at all .
Many times people ignore it .
These inflammations are not permanent , that is , they keep coming and going .
Therefore many times they are not even diagnosed for years .
Apart from diseases like AIDS , syphilis infection may also lead to diseases like blindness , mental imbalance and heart attack .
Many times even deaths occur because of syphilis infection .
If you are infected and pregnant , then you can even lose the child .
For safety together with condoms pay full attention to hygiene also .
Get the infection checked at regular intervals .
If the infection has spread then immediately get the treatment done .
With the help of injection one can control it within 24 hours .
Tykomonosis infection spreads through a parasite .
The main symptom for this is the green and yellow vaginal discharge in women .
Apart from this , itching near or inside vagina with discomfort at the time of micturition is also a common symptom .
There are no symptoms for this infection in most of the men .
But many times burning sensation inside the phallus is the symptom for tykonomosis .
Pay full attention to hygiene and get check up done regularly .
According to Dr Preeti maximum STD are bacterial .
For safety against STD , If together with correct information attention is paid to some common things then the chances of these can be decreased .
Health and regular check up .
Generally most of the women do not get regular checkups , because of which they have to face dangerous diseases afterwards .
Generally , in girls , pap starts occurring after the age of 15 years .
The white discharge happening to girls generally after menstruation or at times even before is only called pap .
It is not important to get pap test done before making physical relation but the test must be done after the gap of 12 years .
The pap test generally must be done regularly after the age of 40 years .
But still , on getting greatly involved in sex the pap test must be done from the age of 30 years .
Pap test is of two types .
Leukoria test is done to find about common infections .
Leukoria test completely depends on physical relations .
Those women who are unmarried or then those who do not get involved in sex , they do not need the leukoria test a great deal .
Pap infection test is also of two types .
One , which is a simple test , with its positive medicine only the complication can be controlled .
Second . hyper plasia ' is the second important test for pap infection .
With ` hyper plasia ' pap infection test it can be found out if there is any cyst in the ovary or not .
The doctors generally advise for ` hyper plasia ' test to women of 40 years .
The homeopathic doctor Minu Mehta says that women should get hyper plasia test done right after the age of 30 years .
Though if pap test is done continuously every year right after establishing sex relationship then protection can be obtained from dangerous diseases like cervical cancer .
Liquid pap test is done for this .
Breast cancer is engulfing Indian women very fast .
According to a recent survey maximum women become the victims of cancer because they do not take their health seriously right from the beginning and considering slight tumors etc as normal , ignore it .
According to Dr Pankaj Kumar of Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Hospital , women should include mammography as well in their regular health check up .
Women of 20-29 years should get mammography done once every third year .
Not just this , together with this one should also do BSF or breast self exam .
Breast Self Exam should be started right after the age of 20 years .
Normally , doing BSF may keep you vigilant for breast cancer , but you must certainly get mammography done on having any node , unwanted pain or any type of secretion .
The hormonal changes start happening after the age of 30 years because of which the size of the ovary starts increasing or else there is a persisting fear of the formation of cyst in it .
Thus , getting ultrasound done every year is very important .
The treatment of any disease occurring due to cyst or hormonal changes can be started immediately by this , on being diagnosed at the right time .
After an ultrasound if cyst is found in the ovary then immediately get its biopsy test done .
With the help of injection some sample of the liquid material of cyst are taken in this test .
After its the test it becomes clear whether that tumor is cancerous or not .
Though biopsy test is a part of your regular checkups , but still on getting cyst or node because of hormonal changes , pain in the lower abdomen , sudden growth of hair on face , increase in weight and irregularity in menstruation you must get this done .
Often after crossing 40 women stop paying attention towards their health .
They feel that now they do not need any regular checkups , but this is not proper .
There are many such diseases after 40 which may take awful shape on not taking precaution .
The FSH test must be done at that time when menopause is about to start or has already started .
In FSH test one can be saved from the diseases happening at the time of or after menopause .
Pelvic exam test must be done annually .
With the help of pelvic exam test any changes occurring in uterus , reproductive organs , bladder etc can become known .
If any kind of unusual change is happening in these then it can be known through pelvic exam test .
One 's cholesterol must be checked regularly after attaining 45 years .
If you are less than 45 years and you smoke then you take the advice of your doctor regarding this as to when you should get your cholesterol test done .
Not just this , if you have obesity or the disease of fatness then you should get the cholesterol test done after 40 .
Maximum women in India give birth to children till the age of 30-35 years .
After delivery white discharge takes place from the body of women in very large quantity .
Because of this a lot of calcium comes out of their body and by becoming weak the bones break on slight injury occurs .
Although 60 years is the age for the test of osteoporosis , but keeping the health in mind get it done every year after second or third delivery .
Bone densitometry is also done for calcium .
By the bone densitometry test the quantity of calcium is found out .
After the age of 45 years the danger of colon cancer increases in women .
Although the cases of colon cancer are seen less in India , but still regular checkups is important .
Every year FOBT test should be done for colon cancer .
Sample of human fecus is taken in FOBT test .
After the FOBT test it becomes clear if any type of blood etc . is coming in your stomach or not .
Flexible sigmoendoscopy must be done once every five years .
By flexible sigmoendoscopy it becomes known whether there is any type of swelling or not in your liver , stomach or reproductive organs .
Colonoscopy must be done once every 10 years .
That is , one at 40 then second at 50 years of age .
There are some more tests apart from this whose regular checkups is not essential but still get them done at some interval .
These tests are - blood pressure , diabetes , depression and obesity -LRB- fatness -RRB- .
Poiseuille in last century came to know of an important fact about the flow of any fluid in tubes .
If the radius of the tube is increased twice then the flow of water in it increases 8 times .
Because of this reason by only making the radius of vessels in our body more and less our blood pressure and the supply of blood in any of the organs is skilfully controlled .
If you are playing hockey or participating in any race then your normal blood pressure of 120 increases very much so that the supply of blood becomes fast .
It also becomes clear from this that because of the muscles present in their walls our vessels can constrict and dilate as per need .
If in place of our vessels there were pipes of steel then would they give service for eighty and hundred years without getting rusted , without getting broken .
Many times with increasing age and many different reasons like smoking cigarette , chewing tobacco , obesity , eating excessive salt , mental disturbance , deficiency of physical labor , the elasticity of the vessels decrease , it starts contracting .
This only will be called high blood pressure or hypertension which has become a common disease today .
Nature has created our vessels only for bearing a certain pressure .
If the pressure on them is constantly very high then it would have a bad effect on their walls .
As a result of the blood pressure our main organs would get damaged at the end : brain , heart and kidneys .
But it is not essential that medicine must be taken if the blood pressure is measured slightly high .
Otherwise , first we should see if there is any reason in our life style which can have ill effect on the blood pressure .
If you take two simple roller pumps in place of the two halves of the heart auricle and ventricle then you can do the entire task of the heart .
Impure blood comes in the right auricle through the two main arteries which is sent to the lung for purification by the right ventricle through an aorta and one aorta from the posterior part of the body .
Both the main arteries open in the right auricle .
If we want that blood does not go in the right auricle and ventricle then we will have to do one thing .
One tube each will have to be put in the dorsal and ventral main arteries .
In short , the blood will come out through them and the right half of the heart will be completely empty .
Medical surgery does this only .
If we connect these tubes which come out of the main arteries to the tube of the roller pump and switch on the motor then the blood will start flowing ahead .
Blood is sent to the artificial lungs for purification .
Artificial lungs are also a very simple apparatus .
A glass vessel full of blood in which oxygen is released in the form of bubbles .
There is a special arrangement so that lather do not form by the bubbles of oxygen .
Without the help of roller pumps and artificial lungs also the flow of blood can be kept going .
Heart - lung-machine is made up of such roller pumps and artificial lungs only , by which the most complicated of surgeries are also possible .
The heart pumps nutrients and oxygen to the entire body .
The heart too needs fuel for its work .
The heart can not take nutrients from the blood filled in its chambers .
Close to the origin of the aorta two coronary arteries originate which get divided on the surface of the heart like minute branches .
Coronary arteries distribute oxygen and nutrients to the heart .
The meaning of coronary is coronation and these arteries are spread like a crown on the heart .
The amount of work which the coronary arteries do for the heart and body then it is correct for it to be decorated with a crown .
On the obstruction of these coronary arteries one gets heart attack .
The collision of ultrasonic energy with various organs , getting reflected and taking a photograph of this is only called ultrasonography .
These days there is discussion about ultrasonography .
But the knowledge about the technique of USG started right from the beginning of this century .
It was seen at that time that on putting minute pressure on some special substances one type of energy is released .
Which is calles piso electric effect and this effect became the base of USG .
In this process transducer is that part which emits ultrasonic energy for a moment and then catches the reflected rays back .
Instrument like computer makes its picture with the help these waves which is imprinted on the photographic plate .
With its help proper treatment is done by doing medical cure .
The popular belief which is more in the minds of people is that the use of USG is done mainly for the problems of infant baby and its mother .
But it is not like that .
Stomach is like a closed pouch , inside which gall bladder , liver , intestines , kidneys , lymph glands , spleen etc are situated .
Similarly in the cage center of the chest ribs heart and lungs are situated .
For the cure of the diseases occurring in these organs situated in these closed boxes normal or special USG is important .
Normal or special USG save the patients many times from the difficulties of surgery .
Liver is a very important organ of the body .
The more this organ is important the more are the diseases found in them .
The infections of liver , cyst , normal tumors or else the lethal tumors of cancer , the clear cure of all can be done through ultrasound .
Similarly , if the blood has clotted in the spleen or there is lymphoma cancer , then its diagnosis is also done through ultrasound .
The kidneys are as important for the normal functions of the body as the heart .
Because of the life-long working of kidneys only it is possible to remain alive .
Whether there is kidney or not , if there then whether it is working properly or not or if there is any type of cyst , stone , swelling , pus , this also is told to us by the ultrasound test .
Till some time ago in order to find this , X-ray was taken by injecting dye in blood , which used to take a lot of time and it was also painful .
The problem of thyroid gland is also very common .
For the study and diagnosis of thyroid gland also there is a less need of using radioactive elements due to ultrasound with which both the treater and the treated have less dangers of radioactivity .
The diagnosis of all the diseases like parathyroid , prostate , adrenal etc is possible through USG .
One very important use of ultrasound is for the diseases of womb especially for cancer .
It is believed that U . . . mammography is not inferior in any way to the popular X-ray mammography .
It gives cure in 75-90 % cases .
USG mammography is comparatively simple and it saves the patient from radioactivity .
The extent to which ultrasonography is useful in the test of foetus in the womb is not anywhere .
Whether the foetus in the womb is twin or not , whether the organs of the child are forming properly and the whether the foetus is developing , all these are found from the USG test of the uterus .
Many serious complications are found in the foetus like the non-formation of the head or even the water getting filled in it -LRB- hydrocephalous -RRB- etc. .
Ultrasonography gives clue to all these problems .
Apart from the correct information about the foetus , one more important information which found through USG is in the matter of placenta .
The properly formed foetus may also get destroyed by some or the other shortcoming or defect of the placenta .
By ultrasound all the deformities can be detected , the status of the placenta , any bleeding from it or if there is any calcification etc. .
By which the doctors can act in time and save the foetus .
By USG that is , ultrasonography a lot of help can be obtained can be obtained in the detection and diagnosis of the disease in the field of medicine .
Very important help is received in the testing of foetuses and organs .
So important , simple and omniavailable technique today is being wrongly used for a hideous work .
Every one must have heard and many women must also have got advice that they should get ultrasonography sex determination test of their foetus .
In some form or the other we participate in the pre-delivery sex determination test and female foeticide and the destruction of half the population due to materialistic reasons .
Because of cataract crores of people world over are deprived of eyesight .
Cataract disease is connected to age and often this makes the people who are more than 50 years of age as its victims .
On getting hurt in the eyes or due to any other disease cataract can occur or else this may be a congenital disease or a disease occurring after a year of birth .
The rate of blindness due to cataract is more in our country in comparison with the western countries .
According to the Blind Control in India there are 1,20,00,000 blind people in the country out of which 80 % people are victims of cataract .
Though this blindness can be rectified through surgery .
The natural lens inside the eye starts getting opaque in cataract by which the eyesight gradually decreases .
This is called white cataract .
In the initial condition though there is improvement in sight by the use of spectacles but with increase in cataract one feels the need to change the spectacles .
After a condition there is no improvement even on changing the spectacles .
At present the only permanent solution for this is surgery .
To make the surgery of cataract even more comfortable a very new technique has been developed which is called ` phaco emulsification ' technique .
To take out the cataract with the help of the technique of ` phaco emulsification ' a small incision of 3 mm is made .
Through which energy is given by the phaco machine and it dissolves the cataract inside and sucks it out of the eye .
Now through this small incision a foldable lens is fixed in the eye which opens on its own after entering in the eye .
Since this incision is very small , therefore there is no need to put suture to this .
Thus , it is called the suture less surgery .
The special benefit of this surgery is that the person can see clearly from the very next day and he can go to his work after a day .
He is finally given the number of spectacles after a week while in the suture surgery he is given the number after two months .
The surgery with phaco machine is done with utmost care .
To do this the doctor is needed to establish harmony between both his eyes , both hands and both legs .
One leg operates the phaco machine and the other focuses the surgical microscope for eyes .
One hand handles the needle of phaco machine , the other hand fills cataract in this needle by the instrument .
Expensive machines are used in the technique of phaco emulsification .
Therefore . phaco emulsification ' technique is costlier than normal surgeries .
Phaco machine is proving to be a boon for the patients of cataract .
The surgery done by phaco machine is easy , painless and can be done in less time .
You can imagine that it is possible to take out any object from inside the body without putting an incision on that part .
Especially , such objects which are very hard and is hidden deep inside the body like stones of urinary tract and calculus .
More than 50 lac people are infested with stones of the urinary tract and everyday there is constant increase in their number .
Till date surgery was the only treatment to take out the stone but several complications used to crop up in that .
But now a technique which is called lithoptysis has become available to take the stone out without surgery .
The technique of lithoptysis was used in 1980 for the first time and from 1987 it has become available in India as well .
In the lithoptysis technique the stones present in any part of the urinary tract are targeted with aim and then the stones are broken by the shower of high capacity waves .
The pieces of stones then come out alone with the urine .
Today it has gained credibility as the most safe , simple and theoretical procedure .
If the diagnosis of the disease of the patient has been done then there is a need of some common blood and urine tests , X-rays of the kidneys and IBP X-ray .
Generally there is no need to make the patient unconscious in this process .
The action is completed without pain by just numbing the treated organ and by a sleep inducing injection .
The time required in the lithoptysis technique depends on the size of the stone and its number .
Generally this is done in one episode .
One episode in this is of 30-40 minutes and a gap of 4 days is maintained so that unnecessary rays do not fall on the body .
When these rays collide with the body then often no sensation is produced .
Some patients may be feeling slight piercing , but there is no pain .
Most of the patients can return home immediately after the treatment .
As an exception , one may have to be put under vigilance for 24 hours .
Post treatment the patient has to come back again for treatment after 3 months .
Then by taking a new X-ray it is seen if any part of stone has been left back or not .
Since the practice of lithoptysis technique has only been 8-10 years , information about its long term effects have not been gathered .
Of course , in complications immediately after treatment bleeding in urine and feeling of intense pain in 1-2 micturition are included .
Approximately 90 % of the patients get complete relief by the technique of lithoptysis .
In some the action may have to be repeated twice or more .
The expense at every sitting amounts to nearly 8 thousand rupees which includes the stay at hospital as well as the fee of the doctor .
Presently , this facility is available in 30-35 cities in our country .
In lithotripsy there is no need of surgery or incision .
You can start the normal daily life in a week .
The action can be repeated if the stone forms again .
The technique of lithoptysis can easily be adopted for those patients who have been declared unfit for surgery like aged , patients of diabetes , blood pressure or heart disease .
The problem of uncontrolled micturition .
in women the urinary opening is between genitals and anal opening .
The tract at the center of the urinary opening from the urinary bladder is straight and small .
Babies and kids do not have control in the state of urination and the urine comes out on its own when the urinary bladder gets filled with urine .
Maximum children acquire control on urination by five years of age and urinate at the right place only .
They stop wetting clothes and bed .
Not having control on urination and the clothes getting spoilt are common problems in women .
It has been known through researches that the problem of clothes getting spoilt due to not having control on urination is found to be 5 to 7 % in the age group of 15-44 years . to 15 % in age group of 45-64 years of age and 16 to 20 % in women of 65 years and more .
The complication of not having control on urination may become severe in different women .
Permanent treatment is possible in women or else control is obtained through treatment .
The complication of not having control on urination , the problem of leaking on its own may occur due to the reason of diseases of urinary system or the various diseases of organs situated close to it .
Urine may come out on its own when pressure is exerted on urinary bladder , urinary system , when there is tension due to coughing , sneezing or wearing excessive tight clothes .
The most common problem of women is the problem of urine leakage .
If the muscles of urinary bladder are hyper active then the muscles may get contracted on filling of slight volume of urine in urinary bladder and the clothes may get spoiled .
This problem may occur because of the destruction of the nerves of urinary bladder .
But in several women its cause is not diagnosed .
This problem may occur in some due to mental tension .
Women often try to control urine for long time .
The urine comes out on its own from the urinary bladder on being accumulated more than its capacity or it getting filled with urine when the capacity is less .
Clothes may also be spoiled by not having control due to some structural defects in urinary bladder urinary tract .
If from the urinary tract the passage of urine is created through the rectum -LRB- fistula -RRB- or genitals then also the problem may arise .
There is an imminent danger of the formation of fistula because of complex , long stuck delivery .
Though maximum women try to keep the problem as secret , but the treatment of this problem is possible .
The doctors try to find out the root cause through investigation and essential tests .
To find out the reasons , the help of tests like the test of urine , bed rest , measurement of the volume of urine left in the urinary bladder , the speed of the flow of urine , the pressure of the leakage of urine , ultrasound , x-ray , CT scan etc is taken .
The solution of the problem is dependent on the root cause .
If the women are infested with the infection of urinary system then by consuming proper antibiotic medicine the women can get rid of the problem very fast .
If there is any abnormality of fistula or structure then the rectification of these deformities is possible through surgery .
If there is obstruction in the urinary passage then there can be the need to broaden or opening it .
If the problem is to not being able to have control on urination for long duration then by the treatment of problem the quality of life can be improved .
If the cause is not diagnosed then the treatment is possible through behavioural techniques , medicine and surgery .
If not able to have control on urination then the consumption of water , liquid and drinking substances should be done in limited quantity .
Do not consume tea , coffee , carbonated drinking substances or it should be done in as much less quantity as possible along with it .
Reduce the weight if the weight is excessive .
If infested with any type of allergy , cough , constipation then get the treatment done .
Do exercise of pelvis and stomach .
Mental tension is an important reason for not having control over urination .
Tension , worry are lethal for the physical and mental health .
Stay away from these as much as possible , live life happily , free of tension and worry .
In these women urine gets leaked on because of the reason of exerting pressure , coughing , sneezing .
If relief is not got from the above mentioned efforts then they should do exercise of hips and muscles of the lower part of the pelvis .
Various methods of treatment have been developed in these patients .
If these increases the will power in patients then also relief may be got from the problems .
These patients get relief in 80 % by using the instrument placed close to the genitals by which the lower part of the urinary bladder gets support .
Similarly , plugs are also available in the foreign countries to block the passage of urinary opening or else injections of dense sticky substance is also put in order to block the passage in the urinary tube .
If relief is not obtained from the above mentioned efforts then women can become problem free through surgery .
Because of not having control over urination in the state of hyperactivity of urinary bladder , women stay in haste , their urine can leak .
This is the second most important reason of not being able to have control on urination .
If this complication is because of the diseases of nerve cells then a proper treatment of disease is essential .
If the cause is not known in these patients then they must be given training to have control on urination .
Stop urine for a definite time and the duration must be tried to increase up to 3-4 hours gradually , do some exercise of hips and pelvis along with it .
Control on urine is done through the medium of brain , spinal cord and nerves .
If the will power is made strong , the idea is repeatedly revised in the mind that I am capable of having control on my urinary system then control can be obtained .
Around 85 % also get relief by exciting the muscles of pelvis by electric waves .
Many medicines are available as solution to these types of problems .
They are advised to take anti-cholinergic or anti-depressant medicines .
Problem in the outflow of urine on excessive filling of urine in urinary bladder , obstruction in passage , damage of the nervous system , consumption of antipsoric medicine or mental tension , may be the reasons of habit .
By finding the root cause treatment should be done .
If the problem is serious then women can urinate at regular intervals by putting a tube in the urinary tract or the urinary tract of these can be broadened or the treatment is possible through surgery .
Unable to keep control on urination , self leaking , feeling hasty , is a common problem in women and their quality of life is affected because of this .
The complication of leaking of urine on exerting pressure may occur in 20 to 40 % adult females .
But the problem is not untreatable , women can become problem free by changing the life style , habits , doing exercise of hips and pelvis , medicine , treatment by surgery and other techniques .
Therefore these should not hesitate , should not feel embarrassed , should lead a healthy , normal life after getting treated by taking advice from a skilled doctor .
This discomfort can arise generally by peeing in the public place , drinking less water and not cleaning the genitals properly .
The complaint of urine infection can occur both in men and women but this complaint is found more in women because the inner part of their genitals stays open .
Slight dirt , showing carelessness in hygiene , wearing dirty panty repeatedly or wearing wet panty give birth to urine infection and may give discomfort of many days to the person .
Therefore , every person should stay beware of it .
The women should especially pay more attention to the hygiene of their body .
Those women should stay even more careful who have already faced this problem once .
When the menstruation stops after the age of 50-52 .
After the age of 50-52 the smoothness of the vaginal tract diminishes and the walls start becoming thin because of this , then the chance of infection increases very much .
The distorted form of urine infection is swelling in the vaginal tract and micturion with discomfort .
In urine infection urine comes with obstruction and burning sensation .
The stream of urine being distorted and not straight , intense burning sensation around the place of urine , onset of fever .
In the condition of less urination the doctor puts a urinary bladder and tube .
The reason for intense inflammation around the place of micturition is indeed the growth of E . Coli bacteria .
The occurrence of urinary infection in females may be a common thing but it is quite shameful and uncomfortable .
Not peeing at public places and drinking lots of water and cleaning the vaginal tract , wearing clean panty is important so that one can continue to stay safe from this uncomfortable disease as much as possible .
After intercourse with husband the vaginal tract must be cleaned with water till inside so that inner cleanliness is maintained .
Light , easily digestible food , carrot , papaya , cucumber , gourd , guava etc should be eaten a lot in food so that the stomach should remain clean and there should not be any constipation .
Lots of water should be consumed .
The cancer of skin is generally of three types .
Squamous cell cancer , basal cell cancer , melanin cell cancer .
The melanin skin cancer is the most dangerous of all the three cancers mentioned above .
While basal cell cancer is the least dangerous .
The cancer of skin generally appears in the form of a small tumor .
This tumor can appear on any part of the body .
Like hand , leg , face etc. .
The tumor can be of normal color or of black color .
In the initial stage the tumor is painless and therefore we commit serious mistake , because there is no pain in the tumor .
Therefore , the patient does not pay attention towards the treatment of the tumor .
When the tumor grows pain develops in it and then on showing to the doctor it is found out that the tumor is of cancer .
Which has spread in other parts of the body as well .
At times cancer appears in the form of a small wound .
The problem is again that in condition of cancer occurring in wound generally there is no pain .
The patient does not pay attention to it as it does not pain .
The cancer of the wound increases and a stage comes when pain starts occurring in that .
But by this time cancer is already spread in other parts of the body .
At times cancer appears in hairless tumors .
Therefore , do not forget any tumor .
No matter if it is proved by the tests that the tumor is not harmful but when cancer would occur in such tumors , this is not known .
Still if harmless tumor persists in the body then be cautious of the following symptoms .
Formation of wound in the tumor , rapid growth of tumor , pain in the tumor , change of color in the tumor .
If any of the above mentioned symptoms appear in any of the harmless tumors then be cautious and immediately consult the doctor .
Cancer of any organ in body spreads either through blood or through lymph vessels : the cancer which spreads through blood is more harmful .
Because they spread very fast in all the organs of the body .
Definitely get tested each tumor appearing on the skin .
If a tumor persists for years then in the situation of the growth of the tumor , getting tested is a must .
If pain starts happening in the tumor of the skin then get cautious and definitely get the test for cancer done .
If wound appears in tumor then also getting attentive is important .
Each such wound appearing on the skin , which does not get healed in 2 weeks , signals towards cancer .
Generally , the cancer of skin spreads through lump vessels alone .
Therefore , generally the cancer of skin spreads very slowly indeed .
The skin of the place which has cancer , from there it goes to the nearby lymph gland and from there it then goes to central lymph glands .
Treatment of the cancer of the skin : along with the cancerous skin the healthy skin is also cut and removed .
By which the danger of cancer being left back is removed .
At times , along with the cancer infested skin the lymph glands are also cut and removed .
It depends on the rapidity of the cancer whether cancerous gland has to be removed or not .
Carelessness should not be towards long persisting wound , towards warts and painless tumor , towards genitals .
The cancer of the skin of the genitals is different from the cancer of the skin of the other organs .
Although the beginning of cancer starts just with a tiny tumor or wound , but the tumors and wound stay hidden beneath the skin of the genitals and by the time it is diagnosed it becomes very late .
At times this delay is also due to the hesitation in talking about the matters of genitals .
